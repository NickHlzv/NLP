It's draub, basic, cabin movie with intensity \"effort\".<br /><br />THE SCREENPLAY: usually give credit indie screenwriters, it's hard work when you are starting out...but this crap.

Some have described the characters flat, want take one step further and say that they actually have reverse character arch.. They actually start working parallel universe and almost start acting backwards...<br /><br />THE ACTORS: Worse than the characters are the actors. They take already poor written characters and add terrible high school drama acting. The \"Woah you totally freaked out\" was said monotone and slow like was dumbed down. could complain for hours the actors alone.<br /><br />TECHNICAL: LIGHTING: eight year old would disappointed with lighting this movie. Too shadowy areas, too bleached others. The director shouldn't use light emotion until learns how light basic scene properly. Baby Steps! SOUND: How many sound guys does take make really shotty sounding movie? With that many sound guys this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has occured. There one scene particular that really sticks out, these guys are driving car and the sound the car changes with every camera angle....WEAK!

      "text/plain": "[Dreamgirls, despite its fistful Tony wins incredibly weak year Broadway, has never been what one would call jewel the crown stage musicals. However, that not say that the right cinematic hands could not fleshed out and polished into something worthwhile on-screen. Unfortunately, what transfers the screen basically slavishly faithful version the stage hit with all its inherent weaknesses intact. First, the score has never been one the strong points this production and the film does not change that factor. There are lots songs (perhaps too many?), but few them are especially memorable. The closest any come catchy tunes are the title song and One Night Only the much acclaimed And Telling You That Not Going less great song than dramatic set piece for the character Effie (Jennifer Hudson). The film slick and technically well-produced, but the story and characters are surprisingly thin and lacking any resonance. There some interest the opening moments, watching Jamie Foxx's Svengali-like manager manipulate his acts the top, but that takes back seat the latter portion the film, when the story conveniently tries cast him villain, despite his having been right from business stand-point for good majority the film. Beyonce Knowles lovely and sings her songs perfectly well, but stuck with character who basically all surface glitz. Anika Noni Rose the third member the Dreamgirls trio literally has nothing for the entire film. Eddie Murphy acquits himself well singer obviously based James Brown, but the role not especially meaty and ultimately has little impact. Foxx would seem ideal casting, but seems oddly withdrawn and bored. The film's biggest selling point surely former American Idol contestant/Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson the central role Effie White, the temperamental singer who gets booted from the group and makes triumphant closing act return. For me, Effie has always been big problem both the show and the movie. The film obviously wants you feel sorry for her and rather ham-handedly takes her side, but have never been sure that this character deserves that kind devotion. From the start, Effie conducts herself for the most part like obnoxious, egotistical, self-centered diva, who more interested what everyone else can for her rather than having much vested interest the group which she part. When she booted from the group for her unprofessionalism and bad attitude, the charges are more than well-founded, but the stage show/film seem think Effie should cut unlimited slack simply because she has great voice. Even though the film tries soften some Effie's harder edges make her more likable, the charges still stand. Her story becomes more manipulative suggesting she should have our further sympathy because she unwed mother struggling raise her daughter using the implication that (much like the talent card) motherhood immediately makes any behavior excusable. Indeed the only big effort the film makes show Effie's mothering tell about and then include scene where she barks her daughter the unemployment office, insists that the girl has \"no father\" and then refuse look for gainful employment support them since singing all she knows. the hands skillful actress, the gaps could perhaps have been remedied with technique and charisma. Unfortunately, Hudson not that actress. She sings well, but the dialog-driven moments not come naturally her nor high emotional moments. Effie's signature moment (the aforementioned And Telling You... number) well-sung Hudson, but emotionally flat the acting department. Effie supposed expressing her rage and desperation her predicament, but Hudson comes off cabaret performer belting out hot number. All all, not quite the emotional highlight one expects. The latter portion the film basically predictable melange events that maneuver Foxx into Hudson's earlier position and allow her strut back and lord over everyone. Foxx's criminal offenses the film are undoubtedly par for the course many struggling record producers, but the film's seeming implication that has coming because helped usher the disco era rather ridiculous, not mention pretentious and condescending, particularly coming from film with all the depth puddle. The end result faithful rendition the stage hit, drained emotion, energy anything that can described dynamic.,\n This show comes with interesting locations fast the travel channel. billed reality but actuality pure prime time soap opera. It's tries use exotic locales facade bring people into phony contest then proceeds hook viewers the contestants soap opera style.  It also borrows from early CBS game show pioneer- Beat The Clock- inventing situations for its contestants try overcome. Then rewards the winner money. they can spice with little interaction between the characters, even better. While the game format slow motion versus Beat The Clock- the real accomplishment this series escape reality.   This show has elements several types successful past programs. Reality television, hardly, but your hooked the contestants, locale contest, this your cup tea. your not, this entire series say, drivel dripping with gravy. another show hiding behind the reality label which the trend started 2000.  It slick well produced, might last while yet. After all, re-runs Gilligan's Island, Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies The Brady Bunch. This just doesn't employ professional actors. The intelligence level about the same.,\n simply love this movie. also love the Ramones, sorta biased begin with the first place. There isn't lot critical praise give this film, either you like you don't. think it's great cult movie.,\n Spoilers ahead you want call them that...  I would almost recommend this film just people can truly see 1/10. Where begin, we'll start from the top...  THE STORY: Don't believe the premise the movie has nothing with abandoned cars, and people finially understanding what the mysterious happenings are. It's draub, basic, cabin movie with intensity \"effort\".  THE SCREENPLAY: usually give credit indie screenwriters, it's hard work when you are starting out...but this crap. The story flat leaves you emotionless the entire movie. The dialogue extremely weak and predictable boasting lines \"Woah, you totally freaked out\" and was wondering you'd uh...if you'd like to..uh, would you come the cabin with me?\". makes want rip out all hair, one strand time and feed myself.  THE CHARACTERS: HOLY CRAP!!!! Some have described the characters flat, want take one step further and say that they actually have reverse character arch.. They actually start working parallel universe and almost start acting backwards...  THE ACTORS: Worse than the characters are the actors. They take already poor written characters and add terrible high school drama acting. The \"Woah you totally freaked out\" was said monotone and slow like was dumbed down. could complain for hours the actors alone.  TECHNICAL: LIGHTING: eight year old would disappointed with lighting this movie. Too shadowy areas, too bleached others. The director shouldn't use light emotion until learns how light basic scene properly. Baby Steps! SOUND: How many sound guys does take make really shotty sounding movie? With that many sound guys this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has occured. There one scene particular that really sticks out, these guys are driving car and the sound the car changes with every camera angle....WEAK! CAMERA: Learn use it.  Anyway, I'm running out complaining space.....rent dare you...Rent and learn from it...give rating..it deserves it.  Signing off... Amanda Christmas,\n all-time favorite movie! have seen many movies, but this one beats them all! Excelent acting, wonderful story. You will, \"normal\" caring person start love George. Altough actor, also himself and very lovable person. And maby most important thing: you will learn respect look different people with Down Syndrome.,\n Wonderful film, one the best horror films the 70s. She realistic settings and atmospheres. usual was inevitable the usual negative comments. have noticed that most horror films certain period many times fail reach even sufficiency. Obviously because most horror movies are old and must denigrati, like mental mechanism that moves the minds the potential music critics here.  Before you read the review already knew what was the final judgment. the film good gift because really well done. Raines reads quite well and the film way which was produced reminds lot Kubrick films. really impression. Excellent film really. consider film anthology years'70.,\n and shot Vancouver with the 'mountains' the low country South Carolina visible the background. For heaven's sake, they should have reset the location. There are coastal mountains South Carolina. Period.  Lame visuals. They should have been beautiful. And the story limped along.  I really don't understand why was such hit book, although have admit it's one haven't read yet. Usually read the book and give the film miss. There was nothing this movie that made want buy the book, even borrow from the library.  Verdict: The Mermaid Chair seemed pretty shallow moi.,\n This the best dub I've ever heard Disney, well the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever soundtrack, themes, characters, dialogues Kiki Delivery Service. Urrrghhh  This one has different atmosphere, especially the deviation from the common heroine. This one has both hero and heroine (although don't really endorse the use hero heroine here, since Miyazaki out from the stereotype common theme). usual, after being introduced Spirited away, amazed Mononoke, troubled Grave Fireflies, and deeply touched Majo Takkyuubin this one start with bit doubt part. Wondering this will the first Ghibi's dud. Well, the end just like Only Yesterday and Whisper the Heart, ended giving rating. I'd give 9.8 rating, but the additional 0.2 there share the good feeling encouraging people see the movie.  SPOILER Somehow see this sad movie, people die this one, the lonely robot, the abandoned place, and ends with destruction. mankind really can't live with too much power. The collapsing scene gave patches Metropolis ending. It's just sad somehow. The plot apparent most reviews and the soundtrack rules well (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber.People who can brings movie, game, event life, even lingering moments astounding composition.  This feel good movie that used part cinema the classic days (It's Wonderful Life etc etc). Well, things change....,\n Linking story: another first-time viewing for and, again, this one the most popular the Amicus anthologies and it's easy see why, though realize how the film's rather meaningless title could misleading for some; certainly fancied director Peter Duffell's choice DEATH AND THE MAIDEN (which, incidentally, classical piece Schubert that heard the film during the Peter Cushing episode) great deal more. Though the linking device itself not all that great, the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable. Production values come off very respectable indeed for the budget Duffell had work with. The latter infuses the film with great deal style which not common with this type film and, frankly, makes one regret the fact that wished distance himself from the genre (though more not typecast rather than because felt was beneath him).  Now the individual stories themselves:   \"Method For Murder\": the opening segment does not offer any real surprises but, make for this, it's quietly suspenseful and appropriately creepy times (Tom Adams' 'fictitious' villain looking like the long-lost brother Boris Karloff from THE OLD DARK HOUSE [1932]); also, ends with satisfactory DIABOLIQUE-type twist, and features fairly intense role for Denholm Elliott the lead. That's all need out it, really.  \"Waxworks\": for the second story are introduced curiously romantic mood which quite unusual for this type film; Peter Cushing and Joss Ackland are both excellent (as well impeccably dressed) their roles two jilted lovers woman who continues obsess them even after such long time, and whose friendly rivalry can only lead them blindly and inexorably fate that literally worse than death; ominous hallucination scene with Peter Cushing quite well done view the limited resources hand, and Ackland's inexplicable inability unwillingness leave town somewhat recalls the house-trapped aristocrats Bunuel's THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962).  \"Sweets The Sweet\": this perhaps the finest episode all with his ambiguous role here, Christopher Lee continues demonstrate his versatility and matched understanding Nyree Dawn Porter and the deceptive innocence Chloe Franks (who appears Lee's daughter). The film's treatment the occult here both subtle and mature, culminating powerful and extremely chilling 'curtain'. Trivia Note: Chloe Franks appears grown-up the featurette included the disc, and when saw her felt immediate familiarity with her face but couldn't quite put finger it. Later, reading her filmography, was revealed that she had played one the leads the long-running stage adaptation Agatha Christie's \"The Mousetrap\" London's West End, which brother and were fortunate enough catch while there holiday the Summer 2002! Needless say, had idea then that she had once created such delicate and delicious portrayal sheer evil, mainly virtue her peculiar look and devilish smile!!   \"The Cloak\": wacky but oddly reverent vampire tale (that still manages debunk many the myths attached the subgenre, while inventing some new ones!) which takes some wonderful digs exploitation cinema and, one point, Christopher Lee himself!; Jon Pertwee marvelous the campy horror star who gets more than bargained for when attempts bring measure authenticity his work; Ingrid Pitt sends her image nicely though her role somewhat subsidiary the proceedings; Geoffrey Bayldon (made look like Ernest Thesiger) also has memorably quirky bit; the 'silent-cinema' style the ending was pretty audacious one pull audience, suppose and, while some the humor comes off heavy-handed THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS (1967) THEATRE BLOOD (1973), it's also rather infectious and certainly ends the film high (and highly unusual) note!   Video and audio quality are relatively satisfactory, considering had other version compare with; the main culprit some noticeable print damage but this never nasty affect one's enjoyment the film. for the extras, beginning with the Audio Commentary: frankly, this one the finest chats about genre film that can remember listening to; Jonathan Rigby gets butt with his opinion more than usual for moderator but his effort certainly allows director Peter Duffell touch every aspect the production (whereas with some other films, you're left rather expecting there more!) and, such, it's extremely pleasant track that complements the main feature very nicely indeed. The featurette \"A-Rated Horror Film\" worthwhile effort with Peter Duffell again center-stage but this time backed with valid, all-too-brief, contributions from producer Max Rosenberg and stars Chloe Franks, Ingrid Pitt and Geoffrey Bayldon. also get film notes, reviews, bios and poster/stills gallery which, again, are wonderfully assembled (with the contemporary reviews being something novelty and welcome one that).,\n \"The Groove Tube\" was one only two Ken Shapiro movies, the other one being the equally zany \"Modern Problems\". This one just full-scale parody TV. Aside from Shapiro who apparently didn't anything after \"Modern Problems\" the movie also stars Chevy Chase and Henry Winkler's cousin Richard Belzer. The three cast members (plus some other people smaller roles) appear various skits. One the funniest ones features Chase Geritol-spoofing commercial, which he's describing the medicine his wife strips, and ends with her humping him. There's also pornographic news program, irritating cooking show, and the epic tale some drug dealers.  Anyway, the whole thing's just real hoot. opinion, the three best TV-spoofing movies are this one, plus \"Tunnelvision\" and \"Kentucky Fried Movie\" (although might also include \"The Truman Show\"). Really funny.  I wonder what ever did become Ken Shapiro.,\n Jean Seberg had not one iota acting talent. Like all her films, 'Bonjour tristesse' suffers not all from her looks (though she perhaps the first those modern women whom Tom Wolfe gleefully, accurately describes \"boys with breasts\": publicists, course, use the word \"gamine\") but suffers grievously from Seberg's dull, monotonous, killing voice. all her films when had play anger, Seberg played with grossly audible, distracting, gasping panting between her monotonously droned verbalizations. Oy.  Preminger's adaptation Françoise Sagan's breathlessly juvenile, fantasy soap opera plot noteworthy only for his lush cinematography but then that's difficult funk the photogenic French Riviera, and perhaps for his apt, but certainly not groundbreaking, employment black white for the present day scenes from which Seberg's monotone narration delivers the flashed-back-to color past.  Juliette Gréco has brief moment, nightclub chanteuse the black white spotlight, delivering smoky Dietrichesque voice the bleak existentialist lyric the title song. This moment nowadays, retrospect, more than wee bit drôle. Except, course, you're French particularly you're French \"68-er\" longing for the glorious days the barricades roundabout the Sorbonne and your kids riot retain the lifelong sinecures which have blighted and emasculated France's economy: then you still believe Sartre and Foucault and all such arcane, irrelevant theorists.  David Niven has the hardest role, having play with sufficient gusto aging hedonist who's yet grasp that life isn't all about Sagan's teenybopper notions hip, cool, swingin', \"mon copain!\" Papa. Deborah Kerr delivers her usual, consummately professional presence, convincingly playing the woman who suffers undeservedly Seberg's spiteful teenaged snot-nose jealousy (fulfilling Sagan's shallow teen fantasy the Classical theme \"there can only one Queen Bee the hive\"); fact, Kerr belongs this film's sole great and memorable on-screen moment.  The dialogue unnatural agree with earlier reviewer who said that sounds \"badly translated\" from French; combine the unnatural scripting with Seberg's incomparably dull, unendurable monotone and you can save that Valium for another night. Atop all that the ineptly synched post-production voice dubbing is, almost throughout, obvious and thus much more than irksome: this especially true the dubbing for Mylène Demongeot because spoils her otherwise very pleasing dumb blonde performance.  Hunky Geoffrey Horne gets the short end the stick here very good looking young man who also suffered from less-than-lovely, uncinematic voice which, when paired with Seberg's drone, yields unconvincing scenes puppy love. (Horne was, shall say, merely adequate 'Bridge the River Kwai,' perhaps because his end was held those great cinema pros William Holden and Jack Hawkins instead being unsupported the regrettably ungifted Seberg).  In sum 'Bonjour tristesse' pretty look but it's shallow, immature soap: thin gruel with suds.,\n just came back from \"El Otro\" playing here Buenos Aires and have say was very disappointed. The film very slow moving (don't get wrong, enjoy slow moving films!), slow the point driving you crazy. All you hear Julio Chavez breathing heavily throughout the whole film. This poorly made film, but more importantly, film without lick inspiration, felt nothing for the story its characters.  \"El Otro\" was made only for the sake making film... making forgetful. would advise you pass this one, you want see good Argentinian films, look for films Sorin.,\n first all let's start out saying that Robert Englund Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark should commended for having associated with this piece drivel. had give this wouldn't let give zero. wanna know how bad this movie is? mom calls from across town and tells \"son, just watched the stupidest movie ever. responded saying \"the killer tongue huh?\" she was like how did you know that? that's how bad this movie is. mean looked like good movie first Freddy pinhead Melinda. okay i'll give chance. sat through the rest this movie only because wrote column for reviews horror movies. implore you, don't waste your time money even brain cells this ludicrous piece crap. run away. far away. you see the shelf Hollywood video blockbuster even your local video store, turn around and walk away....and still want two hours back dang,\n Ever heard taiwanese horror movie? any taiwanese movie? Propably for reason. This one was really boring one, even though has black magic including withered baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands eels.  Having read other peoples thoughts, was looking forward for some violence and gore, but there's not much all. Some blood puking and other lame stuff, you are waiting for graphic gore any gruesome effects you will disappointed. They clearly didn't use the eel exploding and other things their maximum potent.  Pretty much nothing good about this movie; single character that wasn't completely bland and few black magic spells, like the eel one. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. The horror aspect didn't work all, the most horrifying thing was albino girl (not that scary really). This the worst Asian horror movie have ever seen.,\n Melissa Joan Hart shines! This show amazing!! There match. Except for maybe Melissa Clarissa Explains All. She was marvelous that, too. This much better than Buffy, the Vampire Slayer. This show WONDERFUL!,\n The poor DVD video quality the only reason why gave this movie instead 10. That could have been much better, this movie deserves it.  This truly movie that covers several themes simultaneously. you not like movies about serial killers, but are fascinated the astonishing bureaucratic culture the former Sovjet Union, this movie must-see anyway.  I can't compare \"Silence the Lambs\" for several reasons. The way the serial killer portrayed, has been done far much better Citizen You see several details his private life, because you \"travel\" along with the killer, which gives you some idea the source his constant anger and sexual frustration.  The only other movie have seen that realistic this one was \"Henry portrait serial killer\". you were fascinated that movie you definitely need take look Citizen,\n found this the shelf while housesitting and bored. How can people possibly give this 10? It's not just that it's supposed feel-good redemption film think), because doesn't work that level either. Weak plot, bad dialogue, terrible acting; there's just nothing there. Harvey Keitel decent, but has nothing work with, and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are just terrible. The plot progression (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) makes sense. seems like the writers wanted the plot certain way and made it, without actually writing the necessary bits make flow. It's only hour and half, but that's minutes your life you'll never get back.,\n saw this movie the theater when came out. grew Scottsdale and went Arizona State and really enjoyed seeing locations where spent much time. remember the time thinking that Barbara's venture into more rock sound (actually and B-to ears) was successful one. was never fan Kris's singing until his last effort for New West. songwriter and actor, though, has serious chops, IMHO. think fine romance. like better than the Judy Garland version and never saw Selznick's Janet Gaynor original.   I believe that they made some changes this long-awaited DVD release. Among other things, recall the helicopter shot which reveals packed Sun Devil Stadium being longer and more dramatic. wish they had done better job writing music for Kris God forbid, put some his original songs there.   Along those lines have some information from primary source that says that the music was problem for Kris and Barbara. While doing interviews for own new music documentary, Rocking the Boat: Musical Conversation and Journey, interviewed Stephen Bruton, fine singer/songwriter/guitarist with close professional and personal ties Kris, Bonnie Raitt, and Delbert McClinton, among many others. Stephen was \"Speedway,\" the John Norman character's band. Kris was having real hard time turning what was essentially pop score into something that could pass for rock. Stephen was and Kris's friend and long time band member. There was tension the set and one point the band was barking Kris Barbara's presence. She remarked the effect that the band shouldn't talk him like that. Kris came right back the effect that they were his friends and they WERE rock and roll! the end, Barbara came around and decided use Kris's band's live performances the movie and specifically sited Stephen's role making things work. gained even greater respect for her artist upon hearing this story. Much made her diva. What she pro. And not gay. Not that there anything wrong with that.,\n This the worst ripoff Home Alone movies that have EVER seen! Watch part and two, but don't let anyone say that this BETTER than the first two! mean, really, you don't make movie, then make sequel with the same characters and actors, and then make another sequel with DIFFERENT characters and actors! mean, would have been this wan't \"Home Alone\" movie, but they DID make Home Alone movie. Culkin too old now, you're suppose STOP making sequels! Goodness, this movie makes SICK! Buy part and,\n The first scene 'Problem Child' has baby peeing into nun's face. For this movie, that's witty. nasty, mean-spirited 'comedy', it's inept many levels beggars belief. John Ritter the kind father who adopts the child from Hell, and kudos him for maintaining his dignity the surrounding onslaught one-note, annoying performances and puerile humour. And what the hell's Jack Warden doing this mess? Slackly directed Dennis Dugan and obnoxious its attempts turn the sentimentality when it's done with the crudity, the movie made badly it's quite bizarre experience. But never mind all that. The lowlight the whole thing Michael Oliver, the most repulsive and unlikeable kid actor ever hit the screen believe me, you will want smack him right the mouth.,\n TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS   Aspect ratio: 1.78:1  Sound format: Stereo  In late 19th century England, young Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) sent the public school Rugby where experiences the reforms radical new headmaster (Stephen Fry) and stands the school's resident bully, Flashman (Joseph Beattie).  Already the subject numerous screen adaptations most notably Gordon Parry's superior 1951 version Thomas Hughes' evergreen novel gets the early 21st century treatment, courtesy screenwriter Ashley Pharoah (TV's \"Where the Heart Is\") and director David Moore (THE FORSYTE SAGA). It's pleasant enough, and watchable, but it's also rather staid and dull, distinguished only Fry's sincere performance the new principal determined sweep away some the school's most dubious 'traditions', and the introduction possible new star year old Pettyfer, talented kid with the kind effortless charm and vivid good looks that should take him all the way Hollywood and beyond. Otherwise, this typical fodder, the kind stuff favored executives eager fill the schedules with 'prestige' product, even one thoroughly unremarkable this. The publication 'Radio Times' described \"daintily odd\" and raised querulous eyebrow over \"all that fagging and brutality and handsome, rakish villain torturing the life out sweet young boys\". Quite.,\n The Dereks did seem struggle find rolls for after \"10\".  I used work for marine park the Florida Keys. One day, the script for \"Ghosts Can't It\" was circulating among the trainers the \"fish house\" where food was prepared for the dolphins. There was one scene where -dolphin- supposedly propositions (or the dolphin), asking \"go make eggs.\" Reading the script, -lauuughed-...  We did not end doing any portion this movie our facility, although our dolphins -were- \"The Big Blue!\"  This must have been very close the end Anthony Quinn's life. hope had fun this film, certainly didn't anything for his legacy.,\n Just like wine, \"Johnny Dangerously\" gets better and better with every day. This clever, witty, well-acted film could very well stand its own but parody the gangster genre, it's truly outstanding. fact, it's quite obviously the best film its kind... the funniest spoof mob movies and even the respective period although, admittedly, this position probably easier achieve when its main competitors are such primitive, vulgar and dull pseudocomedies \"Jane Austen's Mafia\".,\n Just saw ICE AGE, very funny and especially nice looking film. The story simple but effective, the characters lovable and nicely fleshed out but what really shines the digital set design.  More inspired traditional animated movies than reality, the designs give you really, really nice looking world astounding use colour. Sometimes the touches reality shine through (especially the water was impressive), but nonetheless, it's fantasy-world based reality. Including loads vast landscapes especially helps minimise the costs rendering.  Pixar films shine with technical brilliance, this one shines with effective uses technical know-how.  Enough technical babble, the film's entertaining, family-friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny.,\n Though the title may suggest examples the commandments, definitely incorrect assumption. This adaptation SEEMINGLY unrelated stories from Giovanni Bocaccio's 14th century \"Decameron\" story collection.  Set within medieval Italian town's largely peasant population, diatribe the reality sex (and its consequences) within that world and time. realistic view Life within this world, sometimes feels like journey back time.  Given the depicted human element its time, one can also see the more adventurous side morality its protagonists well the ironies Life, times. may also viewed general satire the Catholic Church's rules.  Nothing terribly special, but definitely interesting one comes with expectations assumptions.,\n Space Camp pretty decent film. The plot predictable, but the actors good job, and the special effects are decent for the time.  This film was originally released about the time the shuttle disaster, and that really put hamper how popular was.  The scene where the shuttle doors open space simply spectacular... the big screen, that is... TV... just looks average. remember this scene the theater. made you feel like you were really there.  This would good film see IMAX, but I'm sure that will never happen.,\n This will best known for the Ferrari that was crashed when Eddie Griffin was doing promotion.  Tale racing and betting poorly made the numbers that appears have director who couldn't see the numbers. Largely point and shoot affair with group actors for paycheck. This not good movie, but its not bad enough watchable and end some what nothing film isn't worth bothering with matter how you look it.  Misogynistic, despite the fact one the leads woman, this film that was clearly made just get the producer and director close pretty girls. Want evidence? There are long lingering shots women next nothing that serve purpose other than perhaps get rise out people too afraid rent porno the Sports illustrated swimsuit DVD.  Avoid this movie all costs,\n \"Fever Pitch\" sweet and charming addition the small genre sports romances date movies movies son could willing with his mother (though the guys the audience got noticeably restless during the romantic scenes).  I have lived through milder version such story, first exposure baseball was dating husband the spring after the Mets first World Series win and then watched the Mets clinch their next one because was the one still the wee hours with our two little sons, who have grown teach more about baseball through our local neighborhood National League team's other heartbreaking failures win again (and was who took our older son his only Fenway Park game caught bit Red Sox fever graduate student Boston).  So compared reality, the script believably creates two people with actual jobs. particularly impressive that Drew Barrymore's character substantive workaholic who has anti-Barbie skills, though she pretty much only visits with her three bland girlfriends during gym workouts that allow for much jiggling and the minor side stories with her parents don't completely work.  It even set credibly how she meets Jimmy Fallon's math teacher and how she falls for his \"winter guy\" though it's surprising that his Red Sox paraphernalia filled apartment didn't tip her off his Jekyll-and-Hyde \"summer guy.\" Their relationship crisis during the baseball season also played out refreshingly grown-up way, from efforts compromise her frank challenges him, centered around that they are both facing thirty and single. Fallon surprisingly rises his character's gradual emotional maturity.  While the ending borrows heavily from Henry, the script writers did yeoman job quickly incorporating the Sox's incredible 2004 season into revised story line (with lots cooperation from the Red Sox organization for filming the stadium).  The script goes out its way explain why Fallon doesn't have Boston accent, immigrant from New Jersey, but that doesn't explain why his motley friends don't. The most authentic sounding Boston sounds come from most his \"summer family\" other season ticket holders, who kindly kibitz the basics Sox lore neophyte Barrymore (and any such audience members).  The song selection includes many Red Sox fans' favorites, from the opening notes the classic \"Dirty Water,\" though most are held heard over the closing credits you are listening local radio and are worth sitting through hear.,\n Guys, you got watch this awesome movie. the end this movie you will have strong passion and profundity imbued into yourselves. The acting the two characters, Billy Sunday and Carl Brashear deeply touches the heart from inside. This movie about principles, dignity, patriotism and HONOR. You will hear Chief Carl Brashear say, the Navy has greatest tradition all Honor practiced thoroughly these two characters. Mere glances these characters during the movie fills you with enthusiasm. Dialogue delivery this movie perfect. You can't find any flaws the dialogues. What the Master Chief Billy says roams and out your mind for long time after watching the movie. Please watch this movie.,\n you're amused straight-faced goings-on that are logical within given illogical situation, you'll enjoy this whimsical 8-minute Spanish film.  A woman enters small café. The scene looks ordinary, but the counterman, customers, and two musicians seem somehow oddly subdued.  Suddenly, the musicians play and one man begins sing the title song dancing across table tops with musical-comedy gestures. The customers, first immobile, intervals chime (badly but gamely) with phrases from the song, read from slips paper their palms. and off they jump and dance (awkwardly but earnestly) choreographed motions, like backup singers.  But why??? the woman wonders. The answer revealed the soloist's jacket opens and she sees what's strapped across his chest just before the explosive climax...  Even you don't catch the song's (probably ironical) lyrics, the situation-perfect performances should give you grin and chuckle... I'd love see again!,\n Whatever happened Keaton what want know.  Actually don't, crawled away, heaving, thinking she must owe half the bookies Vegas, maybe not, maybe she was just brainwashed, blackmailed and bored death. Rich enough adopt third-world country, she somehow had star yet another cookie-cut, cliché-ridden drool'athon, based the same character-franchise she's been rehashing since 'Father the Bride'('91). You'd think she's going head head with Mr.Bean.  (Spoilers)   So hubby (Dax) get's fired obnoxious son boss, his mom (Keaton)leaves his dad after classic row, and crashes over with her own dog-show tow, those little rascals. Hubby's got cold-feet for diaper-duty, wifey's clock a-ticking and hey, let's toss space-cadet second house-guest for good measure, all one day because that's funny and original. Wife gets fed and walks away, mom leaves dad for space-cadet and the couple makes time for closing credits, very long minutes later.  Now you have have space-cadet, can't devious well, can't scheme some excuse for his stayover, and mom leaves dad, she can't hop into cab dressed pumpkin just because some scriptwriter agonized over how cheer thing up.   Plus that gag whereby they invite her only then discover she's got her canine entourage the cab has got outlawed now. And you only get one obnoxious 2-dimensional boss denigrate. Another movie-killer would the movie-script the space cadet toiling away at, supposedly more lame than the actual one, again, dejas-ad-nausea.  Liv Tyler doesn't seem happy here, her voice was weird times, had wondering they later had her redub some it, and she's smart one, she's handled great roles and we'll forgive her for Jersey Girl, was disaster-prone, could happen anyone. Dax Shepard was watchable and that's being generous considering the material.  Personally, it's the director, the screenwriters and especially the producers that would love see tar'n'feathered before shipped Guantanamo playthings for the prisoners, and that's keeping this 'lite'.,\n Creative use modern and mystical elements: 1956 Cadillac convertible transport evil stepmother Kathleen Turner (John Waters' \"Serial Mom\") and the twisted sisters; Queen Mab the faerie godmother; David Warner (Evil \"Time Bandits\") redcoat court; Cinderella (she's babe) shovelling coal into insatiable furnace; Cinderella and her prince charming both look like (and act like) rock stars. Isle Man locations.,\n collector movie memorabilia, had buy the movie poster for this film which, now that I've finally seen it, has the best thing about it. There's nothing more attractive hang your wall than 27x41 inch image the melting man. However, there's nothing more awful put your VCR than hour and half long image the melting man. first thought this movie was pure garbage but then realized that did have some qualities which made laugh. The character Dr. Ted Nelson has the most wishy-washy persona ever brought the big screen. His dialogue trite it's unbelievable! (\"It's incredible! seems getting stronger melts!)  And could somebody tell please how the heck they know exactly how much time Steve has left before melts completely and exactly what their plan \"help\" him? this movie was meant scare its audience, think missed its calling.,\n Final Justice has the great Joe Don Baker running around Texas, shooting people who shoot people. Then he's off Malta where shoots more people. gets locked many times for shooting people. Then gets into gunfight with the bad guy, who dressed like monk. There boat chase, and Joe Don winds jail again. Finally Joe Don, with the help from Elaine from \"Seinfeld\" kill the bad guy, blow boat two and someone gets shot with flare. All this and catchy theme song, just like Mitchell!,\n must admit that have been sucker for Samurai flicks since can remember. used watch rather indiscriminate, \"elitist\" works like The Seven Samurai the bloody comic-book variation like Lone Wolf and Cub. also liked US-/Japanese \"Crossovers\" like The Bushido Blade. And course everything containing Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada. And I've virtually watched every Samurai least twice. But not Kabuto.  In 1993 first watched Kabuto video, that even Samurai films can boring. the beginning was looking forward Mayeda reaching Europe and the confrontations that would come from that but the time actually reached Spain, really didn't care much for the movie anymore.  It wouldn't the film justice call \"bad\". Technically it's clean entry into the genre. But there simply never quiet enough. Sho Kosugi has limited skills both director and actor and has only fraction above mentioned Japanese actors charisma. And speaking Sho Kosugis son Kane, who appears almost all Sho Kosugi films Shos son: has inherited little-to-none his fathers limited acting skills. Adding the minus-points the absence the blood and gore that until then was trademark all Samurai film. This was obviously intended for younger US- European audience.  Lets just say that it's so-so film for the average historic-action-adventure fan but bore for hardened fans Samurai cinema. Fans who are into the \"Samurai meets \"-genre, should rather and watch Red Sun (1971), featuring Charles Bronson cowboy who has team with Samurai Toshiro Mifume retrieve samurai sword from bad-guy Alan Delon. pretty much how right and where Kabuto went wrong.  So, even though the film mere 100 minutes, seems like much longer film.  The reason gave this honourable 4/10 points instead 3/10: First time saw this film, saw the German synchronized version. this version, Kosugi can actually understood. must admit that his 'Engrish' times funny but gets tiresome after about minutes.,\n The ultimate goal Big Brother, that know what think before think it, has been realized. some kind miracle, sinister joke, that people don mental straight jackets their own volition, twist themselves into contorted shapes, and grin like apes? Movies, art, longer risk the unknown, but are forgone conclusions, drained life.  \"The Notorious Bettie Page\" bland case history, fit for freshman college feminism course. Its lesson schematic, right-angled and linear: \"See how women are objectified, exploited, abused, then tossed the trash heap, male-dominated society.\"  Bettie Page, supposedly, was the \"pin-up queen the 1950's,\" the ass millions men ejaculated to. (All reviewers repeat that phrase, \"pin-up queen the 1950's,\" like choir monkeys.) Her history American sex bomb familiar: Southern, abused her father, raped, etc. this movie she naïf, innocent unaware the prurient interests she serves and shamelessly profits from. Although she believes Jesus, she enjoys frolicking nude before camera lens just the wholesome girl-next-door sex-slave American males supposedly fantasize.  From the mouth writer-director Mary Harron herself, Oxford-educated AND ex-punker (do you smell the combined rot privilege and \"hipness\" do?): feel that without feminism, wouldn't doing this. ... don't make feminist films the sense that don't make anything ideological. But find that women get films better.\" What cozy clique.  The movie merely goes through the motions telling the story human life, it's subject and purpose having been eulogized and interred well before the movie began. Ms. Page has boyfriend, but are shown next nothing about their relationship. fact, there are intimate detailed relationships the film.   One can't ignore its smug simplicity. New York, where Ms. Page tries her best fit into and appease man's world, letting herself tied the ropes bondage and tightly laced into the black leather boots and bodices the movie black and white. But down Miami, where she goes get away from all, gleefully takes off her clothes, and photographed \"liberated\" female, the movie turns into color.  Like hell Harron doesn't \"make feminist films,\" doesn't \"make anything ideological.\" Ideology has become internalized, assumed, programmed, that it's almost invisible. Big Brother must smiling.,\n Salva and his pal Bigardo have been the margin the law during most their lives. see them panhandling car the underground, where their pitch get donations lame, one gives them anything! Salva, who hardened petty criminal doesn't even have any redeeming qualities, that is, until discovers reality show television that gives him the idea what next. Religion and show business prove winning combination, something that Salva capitalizes on.  He and Bigardo have been jail after the accidental death priest that was critical the duo. Salva shows natural for the reality show. transforms himself into Christ-like figure who instant success the program. Espe, who no-nonsense woman who show's producer, can't escape from the way Salva pays her unusual attention. Ultimately, Salva the victim his own success the end.  Jordi Molla, whose first directorial job this movie is, had some success the way the film satirizes the role television. Spain, which was vulnerable these types programs, has seen its share the bizarre, which what the director felt assault the viewing public and wanted set his story from the point view the people that are making fortune out the naive audience.  The ensemble cast has some good moments the film. Mr. Molla, like any actor who decides direct his first feature, would have been more effective concentrating the picture front the camera. Candela Pena, good actress, one the best reasons for watching the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the rest responded well the new director.,\n Dennis Hopper without doubt one the finest underrated American actors our time, and was interesting see how would play out his role cop the case child serial killer. Most movies Hopper has always played psychotic menace threatening blow stuff killing spree, but this movie, Hopper tried his best keep that intensity and emotion while carrying shield. Once got into the plot the movie, was hooked, but it's just the little things that ultimately murdered the film.  The concept the film great not only are the cops the move catching the killer, but get chance see how the gangsters operate catching the killer. The subplot the football stadium kinda ridiculous, but necessary involve the gangsters the killer hunt.  That's about all that good you can say about the film. Although Hopper did try act like tough, experienced street smart cop, can't help but feel his acting was below par, and there wasn't enough conviction that was truly attached the case. The directing was also terrible didn't have the feel true film, but rather TV-movie production. This most evident when the gangsters meet for the first time form elite team hunt the killer down. When the leading gangster shoots the other mouthy gangster slow motion, the acting was weak, predictable and terribly unexciting. That's when knew that 1st all, the action going atrocious.  The angling the camera was amateurish, and the recalling scenes haunting images the killer's little sister had true distinctive effect. was supposed scary, wasn't. Everyone's acting was terrible, and even for Hopper, didn't feel for his character, and just didn't really care too much about his relationship with his daughter.  The final thing that bothered the most the swat team. Once saw the swat team action, was thinking, finally, something good. But was wrong. 1st all, the entire swat team consisted guys. That just impossible. 2nd all, apparently the swat team has training whatsoever because many times the film they carry their HKA4 submachine guns with one hand. Had the killer been hiding near the staircase with shotgun, these idiots would've been blown bits because they weren't even aiming anything paying close attention. They should have had both hands the gun aiming forward, but just looks like they're not taking the job seriously and are just flaunting around. 3rd, SWAT team members not yell out commands such \"Keep your eyes open, watch out for yourselves, are good go...etc.\" reality, they use hand signals have radios. But they're literally yelling each other how are you supposed catch the killer when can hear you're coming??? And top all off, these guys have plan apparently they're just running and down going wild turkey chase. Eventually they end doing nothing. That was the last straw. I'm expert special forces, but basically what I've just outlined, pretty common sense. When the audience knows the movie terrible, the action pretty much becomes the life-saver the movie when you can't even make effort make the action great, the movie lost.  I give stars for the concept, but the rest cannot credited. you want watch crime thriller, don't bother with this one. There's plenty crime the movie but has the lack thrill.,\n That hilarious line typical what these naughty sisters say. (It's funny its own terms and pretty funny unintentionally too.) Only two the sisters are really bad. Boy, are they bad, too! One given pinup poses and salacious comments where e'er she goes. The other got look like Marilyn Monroe. She has those sensual, slightly parted lips. And, not give anything away, she even more bad than the other.  All three sisters are played starlets. The man who stumbles into their lives played John Bromfield. had something career.  This looks today like possibly the first mainstream soft-core porn ever marketed. Well, course not the first but the raciest that time.  The girls wear little possible and let's not forget about the female audience members: Bromfield shown shaving with electric razor whose fetish was this? bare-chested. also shown sopping wet swimsuit.  There's real plot here, too: The girls' family, see, cursed. They are prone suicide dramatic deaths that can made seem like suicide.  The movie not bad. truly don't know where was shown. Maybe was made for drive-ins. Somehow, and could wrong, felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here. The women are scantily dressed. They often resemble lurid covers mags like Police Detective jackets dime novels.  But the guy seems the central focus. Not everyone the movie likes him, but all the girls love him. And think the audience meant also.  It's lots fun and its own terms, too.,\n This true \"80's movie\": Back then they made maybe 100 times more movies than nowadays, and that makes many them quite interesting... was cultural phenomenon, that don't exist anymore. Nowadays maybe the same kind people that would have made cheap \"straight-to-video\"-movies the eighties, are doing cheap porn. Porn seems sell. Anyway, this above the medium trash-movie level: has good&fascinating story, and it's quite well made think. one scene you can even see the microphone swinging the upper edge the picture. course there are also little cameos Ozzy and Gene Simmons, but they don't very much contribute the film \"success\", although they are good their small roles. The monster,heavy-singer \"Sammi Curr\", looks really terrible, especially when he's singing. One the scariest monsters I've seen horror flicks. may have nightmares him next night. Not recommended for intellectual movie lovers.,\n This must-see documentary movie for anyone who fears that modern youth has lost its taste for real-life adventure and its sense morality. Darius Goes West amazing roller-coaster story. live the lives Darius and the crew they embark the journey lifetime. Darius has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, disease which affects all the muscles his body. confined wheelchair, and needs round-the-clock attention. how could this crew young friends possibly manage take him 6,000 mile round-trip the West Coast and back? Watch the movie and experience the ups and downs this great adventure laugh and cry with the crew they cope with unimaginable challenges along the way, and enjoy the final triumph when they arrive back three weeks later their home town rapturous reception and some great surprises!,\n boy and girl chased local warrior because the boy killed (by accident) the warriors father (or whoever was). And they travel through the nature Africa's most ruff areas.  The acting this movie isn't that good (except for that elephant kid). But it's very good adventure and it's not very censored, there some blood, flesh and nudity (which lighten the movie bit).  I give this movie because it's picture the African nature and it's action.,\n Though can't claim comic book fanatic, have read share, guess I'm part the audience this film, and wasn't disappointed. does run out steam near the end, it's almost overflowing with ideas, and seems like Lena Olin, one favorite actresses, was left the cutting room floor. Also, little Hank Azaria's Blue Raja can long way. Still, it's easy forgive all these faults when you have film which this much fun. All the actors seem having blast with their roles, especially William Macy the straight-arrow Shoveler, and Janeane Garofalo The Bowler. And unlike some, found the design the city make the joke even funnier. also liked how disco was the music choice the bad guys; somehow, seemed appropriate.,\n once promised never walk out any film personal policy that made suffer through the most different kinds dreck, such Rambo Baise Moi, Deep Impact) but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was truly awful experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are miserable, pathetic bunch retards. shows world where love and humanity don't exist, world where people humiliate each other only for one reason distract from their own miserable existence. choosing documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most them look like straight from the imagination Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix) director Seidl wants make believe that this real life Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs. The viewer confronted with depictions sex orgies, violence against women and handicapped people, madness and degradation. But this isn't social criticism. This just pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead you get bad acting, bad cinematography, bad filmmaking. anybody needs film like this realize that there are things wrong our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes. This pseudo-social criticism with sledge hammer. And looks down people disgustingly condescending way. shows ugly people that not the reason why hate it. But depicts average people ugly, misanthropic way. And this why this film truly despicable.,\n The Woman Black (1989) adaptation Susan Hill's modern classic ghost story, published only few years earlier than the film was made. Sadly, this film has not been released DVD, and far aware has been deleted VHS. It's availability direct contrast it's popularity amongst those the know about horror films. The story revolves around events seaside community the early 20th century where young solicitor sent his firm conclude the affairs recently deceased widow, who died her isolated marshland estate. What thought would routine and probably tedious task turns into nightmare discovers that the old woman was haunted her death, and that the ghosts her past are not content rest. The story told subtle but concise way, never being self-indulgent, flashy over-expositional. The obviously tight budget may have contributed the no-nonsense approach, but it's just what the story needs, and why works well. It's what you don't see that scares. Having said that, there one particularly terrifying scene that relies the visual, and works perfection. watched this film during the day, and still gave nightmares nearly week later. you love being terrified, what you must get hold and watch copy The Woman Black.,\n This documentary incredibly thought-provoking, bringing you the lives two long-time lovers who are the final stages AIDS. The past footage their twenty-some-odd years together really brings their final moments home.  If this movie doesn't make you feel the pain and agony these two fascinating people, you don't have heart.,\n Ben Arthur COULD have been 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, stared, and produced this movie. Sam should have given his idea good writer, director, and left the acting somebody who could act. this good example one person controlling the whole production. there was nobody tell him, \"Sam this bad, really bad\".  Jamie Brett Gabel's acting was the only good point, but could have been much better with good director, and better actors work with.   This movie bad think Sam Mraovich should tied chair and made watch this movie (twice). the acting and direction was bad, this movie was turned into comedy. you just had laugh, and the wrong places.   A second good point....this would make great date movie. after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention your date!,\n was very skeptical about sacrificing precious time watch this film. didn't enjoy the first one all, and the last Jean Claude Van Damme film liked was Blood Sports! After managing sit through all? Avoid, avoid, avoid!!,\n For quite long time life, either did not like this film, liked this film but not much many more. watched recently (at sleepover, funnily enough) and liked more than had done since was under something. now appreciate more, with few other Disney classics that have watched recently (including \"Sleeping Beauty\" and \"Pinnochio\" however you spell it).   I now very much appreciate the animation, the clever \"Disney\" plot turns, the humour from the mice, the emotions expressed and the plot. The animation very well done, often seems you are wherever the other characters are, watching them. The animation also does well portraying the styles the backgrounds, including the town (which shown twice briefly). Disney changes this from the original fairy tale surprisingly good way, injecting clever plot turns ,such the mice making the clothes and the key part (usually not like Disney films very much they are not that similar the original story, but with this not overly bothered. feel they made necessary changes make this good Disney film. Often not think Disney changed the book good way some their films).   You know the story already, Cinderella girl working for her horrible stepmother and stepsisters. She goes ball with the help her fairy godmother and loses glass slipper...  This film very much watched with other people. Immediate family not good enough. enjoy this, recommend you watch with friends (and immediate family, you like. :-)   I recommend this people who like Disney least little bit, people who like fairy tales and for people who like mice. Enjoy! :-),\n The shame it! There was, comfortable the arm chair with beer and bag popcorn, bouyant the hope another splendid Muppet night entertainment. What did get? Disappointed! How can the Muppets from the sublime Christmas Carol this? The humour was dreadful, the songs were worse than Country and Western (and that's saying something) and the plot was confused and poor Blind Pew. think the main problem was that they bit off too much attempting Treasure Island. short tale, such Christmas Carol, perfect because you can weave the Muppet high jinks around it....here the need drag the plot along stopped all the fun. Where the Muppets next? How about Muppets Wizard Oz?,\n One the great things about many the superb Chinese movies you can find, you are lucky, the video stores, they are very accurate retellings actual, true stories. Farewell, Concubine, The Emperor and the Assassin and this movie are perfect examples. The film makers take true story and work hard accurately create movie without compromising the facts for dramatic commercial convenience the hallmark much Hollywood, and especially Disney films.  In this story follow the later years famous local street performer dubbed the King Masks for his mastery Sichuan Change Art. Along having lost his only son many years earlier, searches find male heir carry his rare and dying art society that forbids females have such work. Master Wang sold son slave trader. All well joyfully prepares pass down his art. But the son eventually found out girl. From there, the story get very interesting, with good performance Master Liang the Sichuan Opera regional operatic style related Peking Opera. Fans Farewell Concubine should look carefully Master Liang's portrayal male playing the female role Chinese Opera. may help them come understand that the players these female roles were probably not homosexuals castrati, but people who have psychologically conditioned totally unaware their own sexuality.,\n saw this film chance the small box. has fantastic and chilling scene about poisonous gas. lot about fanatical patriotism. bit eroticism. can't believe it's still waiting for votes!!,\n All could think while watching this movie was B-grade slop. Many have spoken about it's redeeming quality how this film portrays such realistic representation the effects drugs and individual and their subsequent spiral into self perpetuation state unfortunate events. Yet really, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant the film whole.  As far the plot concerned, was lacklustre, unimaginative, implausible and convoluted. You can read most other reports this film and they will say pretty much the same would.  Granted some the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action... looks can only carry film far. The action poor and intermittent: few punches thrown here and there, and final gunfight towards the end. Nothing really write home about.  As others have said, 'BAD' movies are great watch for the very reason that they are 'bad', you revel that fact. This film, however, void. It's nothing.  Furthermore, one really need educational movie scare people away from drug use then would seriously recommend any number other movies out there that board such issues much more effective way. 'Requiem For Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Loathing Las Vegas' and 'Candy' are just few examples. Though one should also check out some more lighthearted films the same subject like 'Go' (overall, both serious and funny) and 'Halfbaked'.  On final note, the one possibly redeeming line this movie, delivered Vinnie Jones was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels'. think that bit that great movie has been tainted 'Loaded' vile.  Overall, strongly suggest that you save you money and your time NOT seeing this movie.,\n This decent little flick made Michigan, about guy that haunted his past, with his abusive stepfather (Gunnar Hansen) and has grown not-so-well-adjusted. fact, he's absolutely bonkers, but tries not too obvious. He's got entourage too, his own little demon angel that follow him around. The demon never says word but really, doesn't have to, and he's Max Schreck-creepy. Let's just say that the angel pretty much spins his wheels this, Eric busy doing things that make him feel better, like \"freeing\" people that decides need it, mostly beautiful young women. This decent portrayal madness, and you're kind your own some point figure out some what's going on, but overall, watched this from start finish very focused the film because definitely held interest. It's little lacking some areas but nothing can really lay finger on. decent effort and worth seeing you like serial killer flicks.,\n Well, first off, you're checking out Revolt the Zombies some very early Night the Living Dead (1968)-type film, forget it. This about \"zombies\" more psychological sense, where that term merely denotes someone who not control their will, but who must instead follow the will another. The \"zombies\" here, little they are the film, are largely metaphors for subservience the state authority general, wartime. quite stretch call this horror film.  The film set during World War \"French Cambodian\" contingent had heard strange stories about zombification--supposedly Angkor Wat was built utilizing zombies--and there are tales zombie armies easily overcoming foes. Armand Louque (Dean Jagger) brings back priest who supposedly knows the secret zombification, but won't talk. Louque and international military contingent head Angkor Wat archaeological expedition designed discover the secret zombification and destroy the information before zombies have chance \"wipe out the white race\".  One the odd things about Revolt the Zombies that seems like maybe writer/director Victor Halperin decided change his game plan while shooting the script. The film begins will explore the zombie/military metaphor, and maybe even have adventure elements, but after about minutes, changes gears and becomes more love triangle story.  Halperin does stick with subtext about will and power (and Nietzschean \"will power\"). The film interesting that level, but the script and the editing are very choppy. This yet another older film for which wouldn't surprised there missing footage, especially since some scenes even fade cut while character uttering dialogue.  Amidst the contrived romance story, Halperin tries keep referring the zombie thread, but little the zombie material makes much sense. Louque discovers the secret zombification, but doesn't mean much the viewer. The mechanics the zombie material are vague and confusingHalperin even resorts using superimposed footage Bela Lugosi's googly-eyes from his 1932 film, White Zombie, but never explains what has with anything. There are big gaps the plot, including the love story. Promising, interesting characters from early reels disappear for long periods time. One potential villain disposed unceremoniously before gets much.  If you're big fan old, creaky movies, Revolt the Zombies may worth watching least once--the acting isn't all that bad, and you've got good imagination, you can piece together interesting story your mind fill all the gaps. But this the second time I've seen the film, with the first only being about five years ago, and could barely recall anything about it--so it's not exactly memorable.,\n had watched this film from Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin'), one night ago www.afrovideo.org, and didn't see anything racial not stupid), admit the character designs are bit crude and unaccpectable today, but think it's satire and very,very urban retelling the old Uncle Remus stories that the Black American culture, created right down the main characters and the blatant nod \"The Tar Baby\" and \"The Briar Patch.\" These aren't bigoted stories, mind you, but cultural icons created Black Americans, and being white woman read and love those stories. And also found interesting time-capsule view the black culture Harlem, New York the 70's.  Well get the nitty-gritty this film: This film live-action/animated film, which begins live-action with fellow named Sampson (Barry White) and the Preacherman (Charles Gordone) rush help their friend, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison, but are stopped roadblock and wind shootout with the police. While waiting for them, Randy unwillingly listens fellow escapee Pappy (Scatman Crothers), begins tell Randy the animated story Brother Rabbit, young newcomer the big city who quickly rises from obscurity rule over all Harlem; you know, Rabbit,Bear and Fox are animal versions Randy,Sampson and the Preacherman. abstract juxtaposition stylized animation and live action footage, the film graphic and condemnatory satire stereotypes prevalent the 70s racial, ethnic, and otherwise.  So anyway, another GOOD Bakshi movie; and should sweep films like this under the rug? pretend they never exist? hmmm...I think that would shame; think should watch these films entacted, and learn about what goes back then, just how far come since then.,\n This one the best films watched high school Spanish class. you are fan the opera, this film will strongly entertain you. course, the dancing wonderful. Watching these amazing dancers moving the music Bizet well worth checking out.,\n And here's yet another piece evidence claim that should all worship the Italian giallo and acknowledge the absolute most unique sub genre horror. Emilio Miraglia's \"The Red Queen Kills Seven Times\" totally mesmerizing wholesome original plotting, stylish production values, enchanting music, great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences. It's fabulous giallo (released the golden year 1972) that belongs the top-five every fan Italian cinema. The storyline doesn't just introduce your average black-gloved sexually frustrated killer, but blends good old-fashioned revenge motives with the macabre myth the murderous \"Red Queen\". young age, their grandfather tells the constantly fighting siblings Kitty and Evelyn about uncanny lady who, once every 100 years April 6th, kills seven people which her sister the inevitable last victim. Fourteen years later, Kitty has become the successful choreographer prominent modeling agency (even sharing her bed with the general manager) when suddenly the killing spree begins. Sister Evelyn would the obvious culprit, but she moved the States recently... has she? Complex yet compelling and involving red herrings are thrown you every couple minutes and the Red Queen character definitely the most fascinating killer giallo-history. Her face can never seen, but she wears blood red cloak and produces the most ghastly laugh whenever she made new victim. She's not exactly gentle either, her victims are barbarically stabbed with dagger, dragged behind cars and even impaled fences! That latter one truly one the greatest most gruesome) acts violence I've ever seen! What more could you possibly request? Some classy and tasteful nudity, perhaps? The gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered, among them Barbara Bouchet and young Sybil Danning. Emilio Miraglia isn't the most famous giallo-director, only made this one and the equally recommended \"The Night Evelyn Came Out the Grave\", but his influence and importance should NOT forgotten.,\n One favorite movies, with very nostalgic ending. The movie about the Sullivan family, obviously Michael Sullivan (the father) one the main members the mafia, the killer say this way, and expert one. One the kids wants know the work his father terrible mistake), hides his father's car and well, sees Tom Hanks action say this way.  Mafia doesn't rules, Mafia nobody wins, when they want you out, they take you out. course you can see anyone who works the mafia with giant house, the best car the world, whatever you like, but make wrong work, make something your \"boss\" doesn't want, and you're fired, and killed.  You can see what mean the movie, Sullivan Jr. sees something didn't had see, and well, almost all his family gets killed for that \"wrong thing\" his son did. The movie really entertaining, you see how the Sullivan's live after being chased the mafia, kinda that.  This movie kinda sad, shows about revenge, those dirty works people do, almost everything you like. Hopefully the guy reading this comment doesn't works for the mafia, and you work the mafia make yourself favor and get the hell out the country before you get killed your boss and their workers.  This movie receives: 10/10,\n Yes, unbelievable may be, 1968 musical won the Academy Award for best picture and was the third musical win that award five-year period, the first being Fair Lady 1964 and then The Sound Music 1965. The difference between Fair Lady, The Sound Music and Oliver! however that Oliver! immeasurably better! comparison. The first two movies are insipid wet noodles compared the remarkably robust Oliver!. The acting great; the songs are great; the story great and the dancing great. This movie dynamic, topical, relevant the human experience and unlike the overblown Gangs New York, Oliver! offers portrayal poverty 19th century London, England that evokes sympathy without being condescending. Oliver Reed was great actor and proves Oliver! The other actors and actresses, especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals characters who evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures.,\n thought this movie was terrible. I'm Chinese, thought everything was totally wrong. Many the facts were incorrect. The only thing right about Chinese history the movie was when Wendy's mother explained her husband about the statues that guarded ShiHuangDi. also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake. Many the actors and actresses were not very great. Some the jokes that were supposedly \"funny\" were really stupid. think this movie should receive the worst possible rating could get. Disney has really got get more information about Chinese history they want create extravagant movie. Mulan was quite accurate. Watch this movie you want waste some time.,\n the writer/director reading this (and imagine you are since you should now out work) then must tell you have seen some bad movies time but this one gets the distinction having the worst premise I've ever heard.  SPOILERS Nothing happens!   A total waste time. laughed out loud the end.   SIDE NOTE (if the whole movie was her coma then does the scene where she sleeps with that guy mean someone raped her while she was knocked out?)  Utter rubbish.,\n Ride with the Devil, like Ang Lee's later Brokeback Mountain, film aesthetic and historical importance. Film lovers ought see minimum twice its artistic nuance worthy over comprehended.   A perfect piece art, surprising depth humanity. really don't recall another war film, will capture you, will change your existing conception history and politics, will restore your belief humanity. After seeing many killings, many sufferings you don't feel yourself numb, instead you treasure the bond between human beings more. The actors' performances haunt your heart, the music drives your mind. Some shoots, are not just some pictures, they transcend themselves, becoming the seeing soul. Such the true sense film being genre art.  A film like this doesn't need long comments reviews, everything says itself. Ovation the cast which includes Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, the cinematographer and the composer the beautiful and lyrical music, what achievement!,\n WARNING!!! TONS DEAD GIVEAWAYS!!! DON'T READ YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS SERIES! YOU CAN, WHATEVER.  They're are few words describe movie that claims the last and comes out with another; Liars, Cheats, maybe even some words that can't uttered. But When Elm Street Freddy's Dead shows everyone who thought the series got old, and wanted stop seeing him, people who wanted their hero (or Villian) just stops for his final breath, This film was it.  This film starts with parody Wizard Oz, Then you see kid who named only John Doe, Who the last child Springwood, Ohio, leaves and gets out Freddy territory. woman who resides hospital/ place get kids off their feet kind place meets this boy, and the same time, has dream about man, water tower, and promise secret floating her mind, goes back Springwood figure out this frightening vision, and soon finds out that she Freddy's child, And soon find out that Freddy can only leave Springwood his daughter can sort host for him. And beyond that, fright ensues. This film seems hit the nail the head everything you wanted know.  This film has tons humor, and cameo appearences, like Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp, and very young Breckin Meyer playing teenage stoner who sees psychadelic vision flowers and Iron Butterfly's \"In-a-gadda-da-vida\", then gets stuck super Mario parody sorts. This film will either make you hate this movie, like Krueger even more. The best the best.,\n Well then. just watched crap-load movies--all with varying degrees quality. wasn't too sure about which one wanted review first. Then hit like sack-a-rats: Rodentz. Warn people about Rodentz. This monstrosity stars nobody and painfully dull sit through. And it's about mutant rats killing people. Yeah... real freaking' original. \"Food the Gods,\" \"Willard\" anyone? Those were better than this, and that doesn't say much...  **POSSIBLE SPOILER**Okay here's the story: Inna laboratory the scientist and his plucky assistant are experimenting rats and their laboratory crappy neighborhood and crappy building and the plucky assistant's moronic friends show drunk and everyone becomes food for the crazed rats and just about everybody dies and, yeah, there's one giant rat that looks crappy, but gets killed, the end. There, all once sentence! Spoiler, you say? Ppfff!! beg differ! The second all realize that there's giant rat, all know it's gonna die eventually!!**END SPOILER**  Here's the breakdown:  The Good:   --Well, watched for free, but for everyone else... hmmm, no. There's nothing good here.   Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:   --Um... well. the gore was decent. --Very average cinematography.   --CG rats not bad they could've been some shots...  The Bad:   --...and other shots, the rats were pathetically cheap-looking. Look, your film has low budget, maybe you shouldn't rely CG. Lesson take heart.   --The acting extremely poor.  --The characters are beyond uninteresting--we have mish-mash clichés and none them are even done that well.   --Booooooooooooring.  --Been done before--plenty times.   --Stupid story, just stupid.  --Giant rat looks like fat man poorly conceived bear costume--that was kind funny--but not funny enough give this film any worth.  --Retarded, unrealistic, and boring dialog.   --All the college student rat chow people are drinking Tequila from huge plastic milk jugs--and yet they don't appear drunk for anything longer than few seconds. Way stick with continuity, guys.  The Ugly:   --This film bad. Simply terrible. Worse than you might imagine. It's not even laughably bad like, for instance, \"Scarecrow\" (2002) \"House the Dead.\" Now those movies are crap you can enjoy. Even they make you stupider.  Memorable Scene:   --The lame action-movie ending, complete with uninjured heroes and explosion. Because didn't feel all like the rest this monstrosity--but still sucked.  Acting: 2/10 Story: 1/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character Development: 0/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 4/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 1/10 was tending son occasionally during the film, may have missed it, but was supposedly there) Violence/Gore: 4/10 Dialogue: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (average for the time) Writing: 1/10 Direction: 2/10  Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10  Overall: 1/10  Watch only you love rat and vermin-based horror films. Wait... Check that. Don't watch it. It's crap.  (www.ResidentHazard.com),\n and sister rented this movie because were the mood for something trashy and not demanding watch. However the movie greatly exceeded very low expectations.  It much more than just representation century. has very real portrayals the characters within and most the actors amazing job. The different stories are baked together with actual footage from the time that gives very unique touch. While watching really felt that CARED about what happened the characters.  I would also like give endless amounts praise Julia Stiles her portrayal Katie, she was great way that stood out!  I would recommend this movie anyone..,\n September 2003 36-year-old Jonny Kennedy died. had terrible genetic condition called Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) which meant that his skin literally fell off the slightest touch, leaving his body covered agonising sores and leading final fight against skin cancer. his last months Jonny decided work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton document his life and death, and the result was film, first broadcast March, that was uplifting, confounding and provocatively humorous story singular man. Not shying away from the grim reality EB, the film was also celebration life lived the full. Produced and directed Patrick Collerton and first shown March 2004 The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off has become the most talked about documentary that year. attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening the public donated over half million pounds Jonny's charity, DEBRA. Jonny Kennedy Memorial Fund has been set raise another half million with the aim ensuring that Jonny Kennedy left one million pound legacy.,\n When evaluating documentaries that focus relatively small group Ugly ultra right wing and conservative groups like this the USA you must consider the following. The United States America with its population 270 million and its complex history aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires uphold Human Rights that has its failings and downside. course expected that extreme right wing groups and ultra conservative groups exist sizable numbers however relative the size its population they are very small and isolated per capita basis Europe, Britain and even Australia have similar right wing groups fact per-capta basis the actual size Neo-Nazi groups Australia actually higher than the United States America. for the above reasons that unjustifiable demean and vilify the American people and their level debate Educated American Society very fraudulently and deceptively presenting this ultra-right wing bunch psychopaths being representative American Society. doing Greenstreet, deliberately chose small and isolated groups opposite ends the spectrum construct image America that outrageous and deliberate sensationalist lie. This film clearly designed inflame and pander the views people who harbor this subconscious and morbid hate the American people and way life under the guise spurist fashionable and cliché idealist left wing ideology. This film was made for profit not for furthering the truth about American Society and the Human condition. Greenstreet can make documentaries that focus ultra right wing conspiracies, the Military Industrial complex but fail miserably present intelligent and balanced factual debate let alone alternative solutions the failings vibrant democracy. Movie Show exposed Anti American its support for this trash. SENSATIONALISM its worst anti -USA garbage shameful.,\n The highlight this movie for was without doubt Tom Hanks. Mike Sullivan, was definitely cast against type and showed that can handle untraditional (for him) role. Hanks usually the good guy movie the one you like, admire and root for. Sullivan was definitely not good guy. It's true that the context this movie came across somewhat noble his purpose being avenge the murders his wife and youngest son. Even so, was already gangster and murderer before those killings. Hanks took role wouldn't have expected him in, and pulled off well.  Hanks' good performance aside, though, certainly couldn't call this enjoyable movie. After opening that would best describe enigmatic (it wasn't entirely clear for while where this was going) turns into very sombre movie, about the complicated relationships Sullivan has developed gangster largely raised Rooney (Paul Newman), who's sort mob boss, and trying raise his own two sons and keep them \"clean\" speak; isolated from his business. After the older son witnesses murder, the gang tries kill him keep him quiet, gets the wrong son (and the mother), and leaves Sullivan and his older son (Mike, Jr.) the run. becomes weird sort father/son bonding movie.  Although ends somewhat hopeful note (at least the overall context the story) it's really very dark throughout, that mood being reinforced with many the scenes being shot darkness and torrential rainfall. have confess that while appreciated Hanks' performance, the movie whole just didn't pull in. 4/10,\n This was pretty decent movie. This movie good just sit down and watch and entertained. Just typical Hollywood film. This movie will never win Oscar anything and definitely doesn't deserve one, but thought was pretty good. It's kind like the show but set into movie format. you like the whole we've got stop the terrorist from killing the president kind movie then you will enjoy this flick. personally think that storyline has been done WAY too much, but The Sentinel does add little twist with the mole the Secret Service. All all, this movie won't leave your jaw the floor change your life, but who says every single movie has like that good?,\n First, let's get the \"hoopla\" out the way.Hedy Lamarr was regarded one the most beautiful women and the movies were perfect medium for the many see her beauty screen.Here have Hedy young fresh-faced year old speaking her native Austrian.I recently bought 1990 uncensored version this 1932/3 classic.Yes see brief close Hedy bare from the waist but although she filmed the swimming runaway horse scenes naked, the director Gustav Machaty uses the cover branches, reflections puddles, medium and long shots show her thus this famous scene; don't imagining there are any lascivious close ups clinches.Her boyfriend Pierre Nay keeps his clothes all times.Yes, fairly daring for its day but how innocous looks now through 2003 eyes.  As other learned reviews have stated this film should looked for the imagary, expressionism, and allegorical statements makes with pictures drops water forming ripple the surface pale water, farm machinery, landscapes etc.Sweet sounding strings run for most \"Extase's\" length and the film has \"feel\" transition between silent and sound its direction and concept.The script highly minimalist and economical the story being mainly imparted through the medium facial and bodily gestures with just few words German spoken the actors with English subtitles beneath.Even these few words seem almost superflous the general lyrical vein which runs through the film.  Put very simply this the story young girl who marries much older man (why are never told and what did Eva see him anyway?Money?), who then trapped unconsumated and loveless marriage.She then returns her father having left her husband and her father has lie his son law.After ride her horse Eva decides take swim the buff and loads her clothes onto her horse's saddle.However her horse gets romantic notions itself and gallops off greet its stablemate.Hedy rushes out the lake naked and tries recover her mount but engineer work sees and retrieves the horse then looks around for its owner.And the romance born.Her husband seeing that his rival must win Eva, later decides shoot himself but thought this was rather illogical and its main weakness bearing mind his previous loveless relationship with Eva.  Despite being 1990 reissue title VHS, the sound being years old, bit soft and with background crackles, line with films its age.After period mourning our handsome boyfriend obviously love with Eva imagines her mother with infant have assume they live happily ever after.Just let the imagary wash over you and disabuse your mind the style films even late 1930's vintage.This lyrical piece that can enyoyed for its own sake and not just for its eye catching title.I gave 7/10.,\n First, the CGI this movie was horrible. watched during marathon bad movies the SciFi channel. the end when the owner the park gets killed, it's probably one the worst examples CGI have even seen. Even Night the Living Dead had better animation.  That said, the movie had almost plot. Why were they that island particular? Well, wasn't stated the movie. And, why would the people keep coming into the cat's area? Makes sense.  One thing that stood out this movie was moderately good acting. what could called made for movie\" movie, the acting was very good. Parry Shen stood out particular.  If you have absolutely nothing Saturday, watch this movie. may good for some memorable quotes.,\n must see movie for anyone who ever went camp, wanted to. This film captures the absolute essence what summer camp all about. funny, compassionate makes you want watch more about the characters once the credits begin role. you have not seen this movie..what are you doing? get off you butt and run the video store. Have great summer,\n thought the kids the movie were great. deal with kids that age group, and thought their behaviors were very believable. did have problem with the reference the private parts made the 5-year old. didn't think the comment was necessary and actually slightly lowered opinion the movie.   I think Luke Benward and coming star. would like see more him the big screen. enjoyed his reactions the situations that found himself in. Often kids this age group things without thinking through the consequences. Almost all the actors did this throughout the movie.  I also think the message bullying needs examined more movies with this age group. major problem schools today.  The ending was quite unexpected. Billy's thoughts whether won didn't win the bet were very surprising. How handled that situation was excellent. Too often today kids are not willing compromise. The actors this movie showed that compromise important part life.,\n Years ago, found \"bargain bin\" copy this film for buck two. many ways, this quite fitting, when was made back 1933, was truly cheaply made film the \"poverty row\" studio, Majestic. However, while the film rather derivative, STILL well worth watching and provides few surprises.  The story very, very familiar, some Germanic town, the people are upset because some recent deaths that appear the work vampires! Adding this familiarity Dwight Frye. played Renfield Dracula, and here very, very similar--though plays much more harmless weirdo. this case, he's obsessed with his pet bats and people begin blame him for the deaths. The film does good job providing some \"red herrings\" (i.e., false leads) and while doesn't take genius figure out Frye may not responsible, the WHO and WHY are intriguing and make VERY different from the average horror film. addition, while the production had little money speak of, still had some good actors the day--Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas--and also used Universal Studios sets night (when they were done filming for the day). result, the film looks pretty good overall, though also thought that, usual, Fay Wray was terrible--thought didn't noticeably detract from the film. have seen her more movies than most people IMDb and have come notice that her characters have depth--she always seems cast the \"screaming lady\" and provides little new each film.  Overall, for fans old horror films, this excellent and worth seeing. For people who are NOT fans the genre, it's probably pretty skip-able.,\n Very good drama about young girl who attempts unravel series horrible crimes. She enlists the aid police cadet, and they begin running down series clues which lead traveling carny worker with long police record. ending which guaranteed keep you the edge your seat.,\n cute romantic comedy featuring two great actors that seem click well screen. Plot typical guy wrong for girl, guy gets girl format, but makes the solid point that one must love with the heart and not the the mind. Addition Albert Einstein and his band geniuses provides excellent comic relief. Overall, good movie. Not great, but good,\n man, know what your thinking: \"With title like that, can't wrong!\" yes you can. too, loved the title, but man hated the stupid kid that played \"Satan's little helper\" hated the mom too, and the sister/daughter, and her boyfriend hated all those people! Man, was agony watching this sometimes! The ONLY reason this doesn't get 1/10 becuz condsidering the low budget, they did OK. But man did hate those actors, stupid! knew was going bad, guess they saved lot money just using halloween masks for the killer, and the Jesus costume the end was really stupid too. the agony, not watch!,\n Along with the \"Maratonci trce pocasni krug\" from the same director, one the masterpieces ex-Yugoslavia comedies. you want understand Serbian mentality, you must see this movie. And you want see several ex-Yugoslav great actors the same time, this opportunity.,\n Couldn't sleep the other night. got up, flipped the tube this movie was on.  Film makers bit off more than they could chew. Just ambitious scope \"Forrest Gump\" was. But Gump read like fairy-tale where extraordinarily lucky man guides through the era. TGMB just relies tired clichés tell the story. Almost like Broadway musical where actors have ham up. Every character's purpose was fill silly 60's archetype.  Take how we're introduced Finnegan: Hugging his black maid receiving framed picture MLK. Criminey, talk about heavy-handed. Why not just give him t-shirt saying Heart Black People\"?  Sunshine: \"Isn't free love groovay, man? no, didn't have period.\"   Mary Beth: want Berkeley, not square UCLA.\" Uh, excuse me? There was nothing square about the 60s. Rather than take the time demonstrate what made Berkeley unique, just hear this brat whine about not going there.  Can't even remember the black kid's name. was just prop used show how racially tolerant the other kids are.  Thing is, period pieces don't have this cheesy. Take \"Dazed Confused.\" Look how we're introduced the football hero, Randall Floyd. don't first see him the football field. fact, never see him play football. We're introduced him class, inviting his nerdish poker buddies party.  In \"Dazed\" feminism isn't casual by-product some chick getting knocked up. It's much more organic, more serious than that. It's refined the ladies' room over flip discussion about Gilligan's Island. Serious ideas can grow the most mundane settings. But real life like that.  Some the warm comments here note that the themes this movie are still relevant. agree! Which why feel disappointed this piece Baby-Boomer pornostalgia.,\n Hanna-Barbera sucks the life out another famous property. The violence watered down, the stories are formulaic, the animation bad, the music obnoxious and repetitive, and frankly, the show just isn't funny.  At the time, H-B put every one its series through the same clichéd situations, regardless fit the world the cartoon not. Thus, Popeye and Bluto appear recurring segment cavemen (\"Hey! Popeye popular, and the Flinstones are popular. Put 'em together, and you can't miss!\"). Also, apparent ripoff \"Private Benjamin,\" Olive Oyl and the Goon have regular segment that features them new army recruits. Seriously! Why?   Adding the annoyance factor are the public service announcements every episode (standard practice the time for cartoons, but still annoying). Popeye lectures his nephews crossing the street safely, recycling, and are you ready for this? the dangers smoking! swear I'm not making that up.)  The only charm remaining from the original cartoons that Jack Mercer, the voice Popeye from the early days, continues the role here.  Worth checking out once just get new appreciation for the old Fleischer shorts. Otherwise, avoid all costs.,\n The world war one the best documentaries about world war   The episodes cover the war and what was like the countries involved it. The first episode tells how the Hitler came power, and how was able build one the strongest armies the world. They also fucus the military actions taken during the war, and the holocaust. One the strongest and best documentaries ever made. All you must watch this. Perfection! 10/10 <br,\n Feh. This movie started out interesting manner, but quickly ran the gamut from confusing dull. The confusing parts happened mostly the beginning, where the cut scenes are numerous that its hard tell just what going for the first twenty minutes so. The dull comes later, with tepid romance between the two living people(pusses both). The vengeful spirit the dead girl actually the most lively person the film, which sad. the rest the cast had been her caliber, the movie might have been better.  Maybe. Because the storyline gets really interesting for awhile, appears that the insane priestess mother the dead sixteen year old girl trying resurrect her daughter from the dead, with the decidedly unfortunate side effect that all the other dead people would come back well, take solid human form, and most likely start killing off everybody. sort Japanese mystical Night the Living Dead type thing. But this doesn't come pass. Even though this hairy unwashed priest with tiny basket strapped his head tells the uninteresting young people that this will come pass the priestess finishes her ritual, she does just that and the only dead person who manifests her daughter. mass rising the dead, walking army corpses, nothing. The priest merely makes the girl's spirit back the land the dead, taking the washed out wuss boyfriend with her, she'd crushed his spine like peanut brittle(at which point was tempted cheer loudly, this idiot went over kiss and fondle the DEAD girl,,ewwww!!!). The Robitussen sucking, spineless best friend has long introspective shot the end she leaves the village for the last time, and that's it. real horror, real creepiness, which the Japanese tend far better than American film makers with their emphasis over-the-top cheesy face make-up, screaming mimis. was very disappointed.,\n handful critics have awarded this film with positive comments. don't wish argue with their opinion, but strongly disagree. When first watched this film was mildly impressed. But after comparing with other films, particularly with the late master, Bruce Lee quickly changed mind. fact, wasn't for the title the film, would never have bought it. Game Death doesn't relate the original Game Death, (except shares one character, Billy Lo.)  I was stunned see how similar Game Death was compared Enter the Dragon. The plots have striking similarities: Both Bruce Lee and Bobby are mission avenge relative. The two locations are similar, which they both are very isolated and are surrounded thousands Blackbelts. There element prostitution both films (women are sent two the guests rooms both films.) Both Han (Enter the Dragon) and Lewis's henchman have hand missing. Their underground drug operation Enter the Dragon, believe not, there one Game Death Han has pet cat Enter the Dragon, the director has used his imagination and awarded Lewis with pet monkey! The list continues.   Regarding other aspects the film, such the script and the acting, felt was very poor. seemed that the director was looking for group martial artists star the film and prayed they could act.   On positive scale, cannot deny that the choreography impressive. Although the fighting sequences have strong elements acrobatics them, they are none the less skillfully performed. However, the plot insufficient, couldn't relate the characters, therefore the fighting sequences were more exhibitions rather than having meaning the film.   In conclusion would say this film recommendable any martial-arts fans, but for those who enjoy solid action film, with good storyline and strong characters, seriously wouldn't recommend this film. opinions towards this film may seem very bias and one-sided, but when Bruce Lee set new standard the martial arts cinema, particularly after his masterpiece: Enter the Dragon, this film failed rise these standards. anything they imitated truly brilliant martial-arts film, hope achieving the same level fame.   In reference evaluation, awarding this film very harsh out 10, the film barley watchable, and must thankful that had the fighting sequences did.,\n There are many problems with Mystery Men. First all there are too many different characters for all them given complex even interesting personalities. The special effects detract from the story and are not really that special. Paul Reubens wasted pathetic, juvenile role character who merely farts and speaks inaudible accent.  Now onto the decent parts. William Macy, three heavenly words, and his performance the shoveler pitch perfect. The sphinx exceptionally funny character who only mysterious and merely spouts out the traditional mystical proverbs. Ben Stiller very amusing well, showing weak character trying make into the big leagues superheroes. All the characters do, and that area which found particuarly ironic. That because all the actors are Indie film actors trying make into the big leagues Hollywood.  To honest, the reason thought failed the box-office that America doesn't get irony.  All all loved the film, but feel would have worked better more effort was put into tweaking the script rather than having unneccesary CGI landscapes and effects.,\n Along with South Pacific, Guys and Dolls for grown-ups sassy, sexy, and full men being men and women being strung along.  There energy and drive that makes this stand out from the pack the strength Jean Simmond's performance, and the charm young Brando, and already masterful Sinatra add much the overall feel and look the piece.  Guys and Dolls wins unashamedly what is: MGM musical.  Still good look and listen too with great tunes and dance numbers will remain one the classics 20th Century cinema and watched with pleasure for years come.  Warmly recommended.,\n Ruth Gordon her best. This episode favorite the whole Columbo series. Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon worked well together that they should both inducted into the television hall fame, regardless the rest their work. Even the music was outstanding this episode.,\n 'The Adventures Barry McKenzie' started life satirical comic strip 'Private Eye', written Barry Humphries and based idea Peter Cook. McKenzie 'Bazza' his friends lanky, loud, hat-wearing Australian whose two main interests life are sex despite never having had any and Fosters lager. 1972, found his way the big screen for the first two outings. must have been tempting for Humphries cast himself 'Bazza', but wisely left the job Barry Crocker later sing the theme the television soap opera 'Neighbours'! Humphries instead played multiple roles true Peter Sellers fashion, most notably Bazza's overbearing Aunt 'Edna Everage' this was before she became Dame ).  You know this not going 'The Importance Being Ernest' when its censorship classification N.P.A. stands for 'No Poofters Allowed'. Pom-hating Bazza told Sydney solicitor that order inherit share his father's will must England absorb British culture. With Aunt Edna tow, catches Quantas flight Hong Kong, and then London. over-efficient customs officer makes Bazza pay import duties everything bought over there, including suitcase full 'tubes Fosters lager'. puts it: \"when comes fleecing you, the Poms have got the edge the gyppos!\". crafty taxi driver Bernard Spear maximises the fare taking Bazza and Edna first Stonehenge, then Scotland. The streets London are filthy, and their hotel hovel run seedy landlord Spike Milligan who makes Bazza put pound notes the electricity meter every twenty minutes. There some good news for our hero though; meets with other Aussies Earls Court, and Fosters sale British pubs.

'Bazza' disgusting creation, but his zest for life unmistakable, you cannot help but like the guy. His various euphemisms for urinating 'point Percy the porcelain' and vomiting 'the Technicolour yawn' have passed into the English language without lot people knowing where they came from. Other guest stars include Dick Bentley detective who chases Bazza everywhere Peter Cook, Julie Covington later star 'Rock Follies' and even future arts presenter Russell Davies.  A sequel the wonderfully-named 'Barry McKenzie Holds His Own came out two years later. its premiere, Humphries took the opportunity blast the critics who had savaged the first film. Good for him.  What must have been greater concern him, though, was the release 'Crocodile Dundee' 1985. also featured lanky, hat-wearing Aussie struggling come terms with foreign culture. And made tonnes more money.  The song the end credits performed Snacka Fitzgibbon magnificent. You have love lyric that includes the line: \"If you want send your sister frenzy, introduce her Barry McKenzie!\". Time end this review. have the dunny shake hands with the unemployed...,\n The film did not well the box office.  I saw sneak preview.  I have always enjoyed the film.  I live the cities mentioned the film where past players moved to.  Not the best film ever put screen, but enjoyable.  Robin did well with his role.  Best line the film the beginning, Robin's character Jack: was that SOB!\" Cleaned here not offend anyone.  Was glad when came DVD few years back the wide screen/letter box format.  I not football fan real sports fan. But, you not need one like this film.,\n This one the worst movies have ever seen. While featuring good actors the movie doesn't live the expectations. The most dramatic thing about this movie the music, which pretty much sums the movie: compensating for bad and confusing storyline having known-good actors, loud and dramatic music. doesn't change the fact, that this very boring movie watch. Earned itself score,\n have say quite enjoyed Soldier. Russell was very good this trained psychopath rediscovering his humanity. Very watchable and nowhere near bad I'd been led believe. Yes has problems but provides its share entertainment.,\n Michael King. This film contains some the best stuff Mike has ever done. Smooth Criminal pure genius. The cameos are wonderful, but always, the main event himself. the best, hands down.,\n Dear God! kept waiting for this movie \"get started\"... then waited for redeem itself... and when did neither, just sat there, dumbfounded that: could possibly this bad, and that had just wasted couple hours just sheer stupidity. had faith that Drew couldn't possibly have made this bad movie... and boy, did ever lose faith! Don't bother with this one! Drew tried, but the movie was poorly written, poorly acted, and just poorly conceived! can't believe script this bad ever got funded! had million chances actually something with the idea, (the word \"concept\" too big for this movie even qualify for!) and STILL didn't anyplace! Its just pitiful! Where the other reviewer got the idea that wasn't the worst, baffles me! Because believe me, got any worse I'd have slit wrists before finishing it!,\n The only reason that did not give this stars was the DVD format-no menus, extras, etc. However, you have ever had dream something with your life, this film for you. you believe yourself and your dream not let anyone anything stop you. This one the most life-affirming films that have ever seen. And magical. The acting superb, the plot serves the purpose, and the opening sequence fantastic. This one those films that \"cult\" status used about. have recommended this film all friends. Some love it, some can't finish it. Whenever think, feel that something impossible think about Alan Arkin's role this film. Sure wish he'd make more films.,\n ...from this awful movie! There are many things wrong with this film, acting, writing, direction, editing, etc. that it's amazing that something rises the top and proves itself the absolute worst. The music! noted that the film has two composers listed. This must the reason why every single frame has music, the absolute worst \"D\" movie style drivel. They have never heard the expression \"less more\". got painful listen to, muted the sound every time there was dialogue, not that the dialogue was that good. You have feel sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I'm sure they didn't see roles like this the twilight their careers. See your own risk.,\n annoying experience. Improvised dialogue, handheld cameras for effect, directionless plot, contrived romance, ick! the whole mess. Ron Silver was the only real actor. Gretta Sacchi was TERRIBLE! Henry Jaglom did better with Eating which suited his style much more.,\n Okay, have come long way from Houston now, but whenever see this movie, taken back little cowgirl's dream one day ride the bull Gilley's. (It burned down before was drinking age.)  If you grew East Texas, then you know this movie accurate depiction contemporary life that time. you didn't then trust and watch the movie. Either you will join the many who love (and the same time strangely repulsed), the very least, you can make fun the red-necks. (There plenty material for poking fun.) This movie doesn't try P.C. (what was that the 80's) hide the white trash element and honest the time and place.  Gotta for me!,\n Problem with these type movies that literally dozens them are being made each year. Luckily for use only handful are given theatrical release, while the others are being pushed straight video TV, such this movie.  The foremost problem this movie really its originality. It's one those movies which uses the \"Die Hard\" formula tough but troubled guy being the wrong place the wrong time. this case it's character played Casper Van Dien, who works for security agency that thoroughly test safety procedures for companies and individuals. this case he's being send cruise ship, which course gets hijacked. You can see this movie sort mix \"Die Hard\" and \"Air Force One\" and the movie doesn't even try conceal that those two movies were probably its biggest source 'inspiration'. really, you can't regard this movie original one all. uses all the clichés out the book and this movie really doesn't offer any surprises anything that remotely resembles anything original.  Like you can expect from movie such this, has very weak script. rather said, features some very lazy writing. Like said before, the movie features nothing original but also the actual story itself features some elements which are far from likely and are just plain ridicules truthfully. mean, hijacking huge cruise ship with only about guys, which halve only carry some small guns and then ask for ransom 'only' million dollars, for ship that about worth times that amount itself already quite ridicules. How they even intend split that money afterward? Every person gets just over million something? That's hardly profitable for such big and risky undertaking. And then there the case taking the passengers hostage. Somehow they manage take all passengers the huge ship hostage and they manage put them inside one room, with only one guy with his pistol, which can't even seem able hold right, watching them. You never see more than like hostages however, they were all the people who were aboard the time. Also when the Van Dien character goes looking for his son and vice versa, matter which room they walk through the huge cruise ship, they always bump into each other instantly. Just some examples the lazy writing within the movie.  But course action flick, the story course becomes secondary. But then again, it's not this movie features any good action all. Halve the actors look they had never hold weapon before and the movie filled with some ridicules slow-motion. really becomes laughable points.  Of course the movie also doesn't feature the best actors, though must say that Casper Van Dien really isn't bad 'action hero' and actor, far the genre and B-movie circuit concerned. just however also suffers from the same problem Tom Cruise; matter how old is, just never looks convincing enough play the father teenager. Van Dien once started out promising new young actor but starring movies like this really doesn't help his career much. He's probably capable something better, though never really given the right opportunity show it. All the other actors also fair enough job but their characters are just formulaic that they never truly become interesting.  Oh well, it's not the worst genre movie have ever seen but also ain't exactly the most original memorable one either.  4/10,\n have watched episodes Caveman, and have idea why continue except maybe waiting for get better.   To this show just pumping itself off the commercials, with real humor. sat around watching these shows, all speculated what was going happen.  The episode the woman cave-woman with attitude was actually big, yea right, for us. she's crude theater and acts tough strangers, and truth told, she needed slap  I consider myself pretty good reviewer, taking everything, but must say, Cavemen comparable the old show, mother, the car. give only because they deserve better than because they actually spent money it.,\n have seen about thousand horror films. (my favorite type) This film among the worst. For me, idea drives movie. So, even poorly acted, cheaply made movie can good. Something Weird definitely cheaply made. However, has little say. still don't understand what the karate scene the beginning has with the film. Something Weird has little offer. Save yourself the pain!,\n This movie was amusing times, hell sometimes was even downright funny.  The underlying message got from the film though, was that women are responsible for all the troubles man. Every time woman depicted the film, she being lazy, being slutty lambasting some poor guy for apparent reason. don't think the message involved good for women gay men.  But, comedy, and piece art, simply someones point view. Even don't agree with it, they are still entitled it.  An amusing film, but some the comments others have made are just plain stupid. Best film ever foot.,\n I've watched few episodes this show and have found certain elements rather interesting, considering medical facts that can learned. But this totally upstaged and wrecked the neverending immoral relationships the show's characters. Everybody seems have slept with just about everyone, even during office hours, which ridiculously unrealistic. There doesn't seem one solid, lasting marriage relationship the entire show everyone broken and the prowl hardly true reflection all Americans. Indeed, there total lack respect for marriage monogamy and it's truly fulsome.  Then are presented with endless little moral 'dilemmas' and they're generally solved such way that belittles anyone who doesn't agree with the all-knowing degenerate management and staff the private practice. For instance, one the latest episodes we're presented with exceedingly rare situation baby who born with uncertain gender and Addison absolutely refuses perform the surgery because we're supposed let the baby decide his gender later on. Anyone who disagrees with this portrayed immature and stupid.  And think that anyone opposed abortion would offended the way the show treats pro-lifers. Addison made the comment that man was allowed have opinion the issue and only one black character was given dignity for opposing abortion moral grounds. The general feeling was that you opposed abortion, you're freak hardly the popular sentiment the US. Two the main characters the show nonchalantly mention that they had abortions when they were younger and had apologies regrets, spite the fact that research has shown women can undergo intense depression. What's more young girl comes the clinic for abortion and then thanks the staff the way out and someone talks about how they were helping this young person and was like something exult in. The script could have been written Planned Parenthood.  All all, this cheap show that lacks much future unless decides present more real relationships rather than just totally unbelievable soap opera relationships and far-fetched medical situations throughout the whole show.,\n First, let state that big fan Ashley Judd; that's why was curious check out this, her debut role. argument that her talent apparent and her performance excellent. guess can also see how the professional critics liked the aesthetic content the story. However, like think that movies are meant entertain and that where this movie fails.  By the halfway point, found myself thinking, \"How much longer have watch bored shop girl, idly standing around deserted souvenir shop, rearranging the merchandise?\" seemed forever!  Then, thought, maybe this one those movies where the director tries lull the audience into relaxed state before hitting them with some dynamic event. such luck. The movie continues it's bland, boring, uneventful story all the way the end.  I'm not saying this because I'm action-junkie. like all kinds movies, especially romantic-comedies. But expect entertained.  Add the fact that the cinematography and sound quality are comparable your neighbor's bad home movies. Depressing!  I just don't get how anyone could like this movie. Zero-entertainment value. The longest 114 minutes life. <br,\n stupid rich guy circa about 1800 wants visit nearby mental asylum see how famous doctor cares for his patients. Despite initially hostile response, soon cordially invited and given tour the good doctor. And, the doctor shows him about, talks and talks and talks!!! And talks, loonies run amok here and there doing nothing especially productive. While there SOME action here and there (and some quite disturbing), it's amazing how dull and cerebral the whole thing is--lacking life and energy, which odd for horror flick. Even guy who thinks he's chicken and dresses like one becomes rather tiresome. The further this tour takes the guest, the more disturbing becomes until ultimately you realize that the inmates have taken over the hospital and are torturing their keepers. Yet again, despite this twist, the film amazingly lifeless many places--particularly when moves very slowly bizarre ceremony taking place people are just wandering about the set. Only when the workers from the asylum found prison cell, starving, does the film have any real impact. Considering this plot, sure hard imagine making boring, but the people who made this cheap exploitational film have! Now with the same plot and competent writing, acting and direction, this COULD have been interesting and worthwhile film.  You know, now that think about it, this was the plot one the episodes the original \"Star Trek\" show! You know, the one with \"Lord Garth--Master the Universe\" and Kirk and Spock are held prisoner this madman and his crazed followers.  A final note: The film has quite bit nudity here and there and includes rape scene, forewarned--it's not for kids. fact, considering how worthless the film is, isn't for anyone! However, with the version included the \"50 Movie Pack--Chilling Classics\", the print incredibly bad that it's hard see all this flesh due the print being very dark.,\n Although the likeliness someone focusing THIS comment among the other 80+ for this movie low, feel that have say something about this one. not the kind movie-watcher who pays attention production value, thought-provoking dialog, brilliant acting directing. However, claim that this movie sucks. don't know why don't like it... mean has almost everything want out horror movie: blood, outrageousness, unintentional humor, etc. According this evidence should favorite. Still, Zombi baaad movie.  There are just too many things that compels you yell the screen. Like when the girl leaves the army guy when their car breaks down find water (this spoils nothing don't worry). She walks into what see abandoned hotel something. Did she not see that there was friggin' lake the middle the building??? Yes she's looking for water and passes lake. Why? Cuz she wants know why the people (who aren't there cuz the place abandoned) won't answer her when she calls out: \"Is anybody there?\" this just little, insignificant piece the big picture I'm painting.  There reason, though, why gave this film more than star. It's one those movies where you forget how bad really is, like have few times, you'll want watch again because it's just over-the-top every aspect. called blood the first paragraph, but this movie has blood, has ocean gore. Also, has pretty weird creatures well: zombie-baby (with adult-size hand???) and magically flying head name just two.  You know when you try think the worst and cheesiest movies ever made and you come with '50's sci-fi movies? believe that Zombi and movies like should top those. has all the elements: scientists arguing with the government, warnings the apocalypse the radio, armies battling monsters, and on. This the Plan the '80's! While won't say that this waste money you want buy it, just expect the very worst. And when you find out that expecting the worst underestimating Zombi won't all that bad. You might actually like it, I'm not saying that's impossible.  Don't think hate this movie, don't... really. Oh, P.S. Killing Birds (aka Zombie rules! (did just blow credibility?),\n The wit and pace and three show stopping Busby Berkley numbers put this ahead the over-rated 42nd Street. This the definitive 30's musical with knockout frenetic performance from Jimmy Cagney. One the last releases before the Motion Picture Production Code was strictly enforced. must see.,\n This movie just plain bad. Weak story weak directing and below average acting. The thing that really irritated was the blatant advertising constantly for well known internet provider. obvious some scenes are written just that advertising. This movie slap the face anyone who payed money for this.  Do not watch this, not worth your time.,\n This certainly one the most bizarre films ever made even for Fellini. About the only one more bizarre his SATYRICON. This two and half hour romp through strange nightmarish world decadence, opulence and sexual challenge. Sutherland makes curiously unappealing Casanova and the odd goings series unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover's autobiography fail engage the viewer. The art direction and costume design are however OUTSTANDING. The Academy missed not even nominating the former but did itself justice rewarding OSCAR for the latter. Also nominated (oddly) was the disjointed, pointless and almost inacessible screenplay. figure!! The film video only 150 minutes, minutes short the original running time. This viewer was grateful.,\n SUcks. That's all got say about this sorry excuse for film. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. mean, what the hell were they thinking? The idiots involved should never allowed make another films. The acting was bad that even failed entertain bad level. The attempt \"lesbian scene\" was sad. felt bad for the ladies involved. This movie sucks! Sucks! Sucks!  I heard rumors sequel.  God  Help  Us  All,\n love science fiction, fascinated Egyptian mythology and appreciate digital animation. figured movie that combines these three would least enjoyable. could not have been more wrong: The story (or actually the lack there of) was completely uninspired and lacks imagination while imagination usually the biggest component any science fiction story. The dialogue and acting are even worse than average porno movie. Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives new meaning the term 'bad performance'. Bad acting wouldn't have been such huge problem only 'director' Bilal didn't take himself seriously; all the lines sound like they are supposed poetic, looks like Bilal really thinks has made piece art here. Well, there's art poetry found this piece junk, only pretentiousness! This man should really stick making comics, since fails all possible accounts director. Worst all the terrible digital animation, which ugly that actually turns watching this movie into physically painful experience. The graphics look fake they even make the werewolves 'Van Helsing' look like live actors! And since half the characters are CGI-animated, quite problem that the CGI-effects look fake. the Egyptian Gods actually exist then Bilal's dead guy, since they will doubt take gruesome revenge him for the ridiculous way which portrays them this disastrously bad movie.,\n wont take too much time here, just wanted state that Darkman awesome. have all DVD, added these collection DVD movie sets. Darkman ranks there with the best, like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Die hard, you get the point. There isn't too many good horror, thriller, sets out there. Many thanks the whole crew, and set for giving the Darkman trilogy. the way your wondering how came across this one DVD. purchased through the internet, however region you know most DVD players are region you own Sony Playstation you have the best DVD player since all region player. Just set then choose witch region setting you want 1-9,\n Having just seen the Perfect Spy mini series one go, one can nothing but doff one's hat pure masterpiece, which compared the other Carré minis about Smiley, has quite different qualities.  In the minis about Smiley, Alex Guiness, Smiley, who steals the show the rest the actors just support him, one can say.  Here ensemble and story that's important, the lead actor, played excellently Peter Egan the final episodes, isn't charismatic all.   Egan just plays guy called Magnus Pym, who lying, being devious and telling people what they like hear, very well liked everyone, big and small. The only one who seems understand his inner self Alex, his Czech handler.  Never have the machinery behind spy, and/or traitor, been told better! After having followed his life from very young age fully understand what that makes possible turn him into traitor. His ability lie and fake everything what makes him into perfect spy', his Czech handler calls him.   And, following his life, fully understand how difficult get back the straight and narrow path, once you've veered off it. trundles on, even never get anything economic out it, except promotion his MI5 spy masters. Everyone's happy, long the flow faked information continues!   Magnus's father, played wonderfully Ray McAnally, no-good con-man, who always dreams schemes con people out their money. later years his son who has bail him out, again and again. But the example set his dad and uncle, who takes over guardian when his father goes prison, and his mom sent off asylum, Magnus quickly learns early that lying the way surviving, not telling the truth. first overdoes bit, but quickly learn tell the right lies, and constant, not changing the stories from time time that tell those who want listen about himself and his dad.  His Czech handler Alex, expertly played Rüdiger Weigang, creates, with the help Magnus, network non-existing informants, which supplies the British MI5 with fake information for years, and years, just the British did with the German spies that were active the before and during the war they kept sending fake information Das Vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned, liquidated simply been replaced MI5 men.  The young lads who play Magnus younger years does wonderfully, and most them are more charismatic than the older, little more cynic, and tired, Pym, played Egan. But you buy the difference easily, that often the way change through life, from enthusiasm sorrow, indifference.  Indeed well worth the money!,\n This happy-go-luck 1939 military swashbuckler, based rather loosely Rudyard Kipling's memorable poem well his novel \"Soldiers Three,\" qualifies first-rate entertainment about the British Imperial Army India the 1880s. Cary Grant delivers more knock-about blows with his knuckled-up fists than did all his movies put together. Set faraway India, this six-fisted yarn dwells the exploits three rugged British sergeants and their native water bearer Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) who contend with bloodthirsty cult murderous Indians called the Thuggee. Sergeant Archibald Cutter (Cary Grant \"The Last Outpost\"), Sergeant MacChesney (Oscar-winner Victor McLaglen \"The Informer\"), and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. \"The Dawn Patrol\"), are competitive trio hard-drinking, hard-brawling, and fun-loving Alpha males whose years frolic are about become history because Ballantine plans marry Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and enter the tea business. Naturally, Cutter and MacChesney drum assorted schemes derail Ballentine's plans. When their superiors order them back into action with Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote \"The Sheik Steps Out\"), Cutter and MacChesney drug Higginbotham that cannot accompany them and Ballantine has replace him. Half the fun here watching the principals trying outwit each other without hating themselves. Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit adventure grand style and scope our heroes tangle with army Thuggees. Lenser Joseph August received Oscar nomination for his outstanding black white cinematography.,\n watched this tape, immediately rewound it, watched again and laughed twice hard. strongly recommend this tape for those who are not hateful of, but uncomfortable around transvestites. shows you that transvestitism feature, rather than the entirety one's being. The comedy not single issue. This man brilliant. All comics should aspire his level candor, intelligence and talent.,\n One can only imagine the film Mr. Welles might have finished without the interference the studio! This film flawed Welles, but worth every minute because one can see the greatness perhaps America's best motion picture director all times!  We can see the toll took Orson Welles the filming this movie. The story has lot holes it, perhaps because the demands the studio executives that didn't trust the director.   It curious reading some the opinions submitted IMDB that compare Orson Welles with the Coen brothers, Roman Polanski, even Woody Allen, when should all those directors that must regarded followers the great master himself. one was more original and creative the history American cinema than Mr. Welles. Lucky are still have his legacy either retrospective looks such the one the Film Forum New York just ended, his films either tape DVD form.  Rita Hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here. she was beauty with her red hair, blonde, she just too stunning for words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made excellent contribution the movie.  The only thing that might have made this film another masterpiece added Orson Welles body work, was his own appearance it. Had concentrated the directing and had another actor interpret Michael O'Hara, different film might have been achieved altogether. Orson Welles has credited for being perhaps pioneer taking the camera away from the studio lot into the street. The visuals this film are amazing that leave the theater after seeing this movie truly impressed for the work, the vision and the talent gave us.,\n love Zombie-Movies and love amateur-productions. And Meat Market starts really promising with nice homage Fulci´s Classic \"Zombi\".  So leaned back and waited impressed. Okay, some the makeups are great for such budget movie and some actors (the vampirelady and the cook) really stand out, but else there´s nothing.  I didn´t expect new Romero here but there not one sequence the whole movie which has even little bit suspense shock value. The director sure knows how stage body rippings and interesting eating habits, but now (after two parts) it´s time learn something more.  In MeatMarket2 Gore rhymes with bore for that´s not enough sorry.  ** out *****,\n This may not the worst comedy all time, but it's close. The producers this movie stole hour and half life, and want back!  Chris Kattan funny for about minutes. His high pitched voice and mad flailing start get old, and then you realize that the rest the movie much worse. falls into long line former SNL-ers that have attempted movies. Some have been brilliant, some have failed miserably. There's not much middle ground this category. Although Chris Farley was brilliant, and then okay, and then not funny, and then dead...so suppose hits the entire spectrum one career.  Avoid this movie like the plague.  c,\n just viewed this great good-natured parody Night the Living Dead, and have say was awful and corny was excellent. This movie incorporated all the antics and scenery shots that the original had including the cemetery, the supposable abandoned house, the basement and the front lawn. What especially love about this movie the comical use bread and all the common household enemies bread has grudge against. C'mon, know that toasters, toaster ovens and zip-locks have done bread dozen times and now must call for their help order defeat the reanimated bread. Aside from the cheap acting and voice-overs, this short horror film personal favorite parody Night the Living Dead, even better than Night the Living Dead 1990.  I think what makes this movie worth watching how the writers and directors utilized all the dialogue from the original movie and revolved around bread, including how the bread became reanimated and avoid leftovers because they are especially dangerous. Another great reason why love this movie that, there exception what bread evil, bagels are evil and even communions are evil, which demonstrated hilarious scene involving newscaster and rather monotone priest. think that the actors are especially humorous performing the deed being viscously attacked slices bread (i.e. the car scene). think the end very worth sticking around.  Even though this short and that \"Night the Day the Dawn the Son the Bride the Return the Revenge the Terror the Attack the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part Shocking 2-D\" debatably another great parody, it's still recommend great horror parody done by, what seems college filmmakers. highly recommend this movie anybody who able make fun Night the Living Dead and still have respect for the filmmakers. would also like recommend this movie anybody who loves D-movies and horror parody's, it's just wonderful little short horror film that's fun watch and learn.,\n don't know I'm just weird, but thoroughly enjoyed this film.   Return Cabin the Lake course the sequel another one favorite films Cabin the Lake. fact, think that enjoyed this movie even more than the first one. also thought that the cast this movie was great, Judd Nelson always the best! also enjoyed the plot whole. liked the fact that this second movie focused the filming Stanley's screenplay Cabin the Lake- wasn't completely redundant film Stanley grabbing other girls and drowning them. you're looking for some deep meaning, then this film probably not the one for you. However, you're looking for fun way spend two hours, then ahead and watch it. I've probably already killed least ten hours watching this film.,\n must admit that the beginning, was sort reticent about watching this movie. thought was this stupid, little, romantic film about French woman who meets the train American and decides visit Vienna with him. was not actually enchanted about this kind script, since continued make believe that just movie. Still, watched it! And was amazed...\"Before Sunrise\" one the few films who dare talk rather philosophical way, wondering about the fact that the moment our birth, are sentenced death, that middling idea that fact that couple should rest together for eternity, that, we, humans, can afford sometimes live fairy-tales.   The ending was wonderfully chosen (we not know they will meet again six months, six o'clock, Vienna's station) -in our optimism, sincerely hope so. The actors acted very good manner, so, that, began believe that myself could live love-story just like this.,\n Although this \"better\" than the first Mulva (which doesn't say much anyways, would rather watch paint dry) still sucks. yourself favor and avoid anything from these Low Budget Pictures guys. was suckered into buying few dvds support some indy filmmakers and boy did regret it. Some haven't even been officially \"released\" yet (not bootlegs-bought from the filmmakers themselves) and can't even list how bad they all are. Avoid anything with Teen Ape Bonejack them they pop other small indy films that they are friends with. you are friends these guys, chances are you were their movies and had fun making them. But for those that had watch them? way. Bad video, bad audio, bad acting, bad plot...etc etc. These aren't even funny. gave this one only because Debbie Rochon and that about it. Maybe doesn't even deserve the About 1/16th star show was slightly better than the first (which wish could have rated the negatives). you want decent budget film, pick something from LBP's \"friends\" over Freak Productions like Marty Jenkins even Raising the Stakes. Those are actually decent.,\n Sarafina was fun movie, and some the songs were really great. Sarafina was very entertaining. don't normally like music things like this, but the singing was not lame like looked like the box. The movie was useful for learning about history because was interesting perspective the Soweto rioting 1976. showed you things from the perspective the students the rioting and showed you that they were real characters. Because you got see them real characters this makes you like them more audience, and makes you more sympathetic them totally the victims the white government, who you can not sympathise with. The singing the students correct because know from accounts that the students the riot were singing and dancing before became violent. The clothing the students Sarafina very similar the clothing shown photos from Soweto. They made the movie actually Soweto, which why looks very accurate many parts. All these things make the film more accurate for someone using learn about aparthied. viewers must critical the way the history Apartheid was presented. said before, you become sympathetic the students this makes potentially less reliable and objective. Also, changes some the details from other accounts. Sarafina turns chaos when the policeman comes into their classroom and shoots the students. The police and army were very aggressive Soweto, but this probably exaggerated event. The police and army did shoot students, but there not evidence them going into schools and executing people like this. The fighting was more the streets and had looting and crime. This done the movie probably make you feel more sorry for the school students. The movie would have been more useful had some different information about aparthied. The teacher was arrested for being against the government, and the mum goes work white persons house. But there not any information about the government and why they were doing any details about the racist policies and laws. -By George Chris and Finlay,\n fragment the life one the first female painters achieve historical renown, \"Artemisia\" tells the true story young Italian woman's impassioned pursuit artistic expression and the vicissitudes she encounters. The film features sumptuous costuming and sets and good cast and acting. However, muddled its attempt depict the esoterics the art and the time and uninspired its representation the passion the artist painted canvas and explored through her involvements with men. good film for those interested renaissance painting period films.,\n This movie was brilliant concept. was original, cleverly written and high appeal those who aren't really 'conformist' movie pickers. Don't get wrong there are some great movies that have wide appeal, but when you move into watching movie based \"everyone else watching it\" you know you're either tween don't really have opinion. This had lovely subtle humor despite most people probably looking only the obvious. The actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and thought there was lot more \"personal\" personality this film. Has appeal for kids, well adults. Esp. nice find good movie that's not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos! great film, not overlooked based public consumption. This one must buy.,\n just saw this film the 2001 Toronto international film festival. The working title there was 'Dog Days'. The audience reaction was mixed. Some people found the graphic sex and realistic violence too much for them. Others seemed genuinely appreciate how good this film was.  This film isn't for the faint heart. It's like 'Happiness' with explicit sex and less optimistic view humanity. There's animal poisoning, strip-tease from senior citizen, orgy'esque' bathouse shopping centre, anal candle penetration, and the molestation the mentally incompetent.  If any this sounds like too much handle then this film isn't for you. This film shows humanity its most desperate and pathetic. The banality our existence shoved our face with utmost glee. <br Seidl has interest redeeming humanity here. And why should he? This film features excellent performances from all involved, always interesting, and probably the most intelligent social statement made film awhile.,\n This movie was very badly written. The characters had depth. They should have never made movie this. old son could write better screenplay then Hyung-rae Shim.  The only actor that didn't suck was the zoo guard. was the only funny and believable one the lot.  I love movies and try give them the benefit the doubt, but this one was there lame list number Number being Demonicus.  For those you who actually thought this was good movie, you are serious need brain surgery.  Most the creatures the movie weren't even dragons...so why did they call D-war?,\n only rented this because loved the first movie. However, calling John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos just con trick get you rent it. fact executive producer and clearly had nothing with the making this film (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?)  A tragic storyline, terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi the least convincing Vampire Hunter all time. It's not even comically bad.  What end with dull, uninvolving film with terrible script and indefinsibly bad and clichéd acting. just reeks low budget.  Avoid like the Bubonic plague.,\n There's lot movies that have set release dates, only get pulled from distribution due legal snafu some kind, and then put limbo for long time. You can only wish film rotten \"Slackers\" remained coma for what it's worth, which miniscule. Release dates were continually shifted around for this truly awful movie that much bleep the radar like deserves. The premise kicks off under the guise Ethan, creepy nerd with scary obsession for the campus bombshell Angela. Ethan devilishly enlists the aid David and his friends who have been scamming the school for their entire run with blackmail help win Angela. don't like give spoilers out, but for piece crap like this can make exception. Angela falls for David, Ethan intentionally screws everything up, the good guys win. That's what happens nutshell for another tired retread the teen gross out genre. Gross humor funny, always has been dating back the days the immortal classic \"Animal House\", the likes contemporaries like \"There's Something About Mary\" and \"Road Trip\" amongst dozens others which there are too many mention. But when you use plot point you can only get far, case point, Ethan has Angela doll composed her individual strands hair which does god knows what with it. one wants take witness watch Ethan urinating the shower while singing himself. one wants watch young man singing \"She'll coming around the mountain\" with sock his penis. But nothing can prepare you for the full visual assault seeing 50's bombshell Mamie Van Doren bare her breasts years old. don't know it's the story's lack coherence, which cuts scenes that make absolutely sense. Director Dewey Nicks was former fashion photographer, and after reviewing this film, you can only wish he'll back the profession. The worst thing you can any film, make look like you're having fun, because you detract from your objectives, just like \"Slackers\" does, burying it's plot outline under pile gross out gags, pointless vignettes, and lack construction. It's like bunch college students got drunk, took one's camcorder, and shot bunch random crap and compiled together. you want see teen gross out comedy that's actually good, then suggest \"American Pie\" and \"Animal House\", \"Road Trip\", just something that's entertaining, and not dreadfully bad like \"Slackers\". Coincidentally Cameron Diaz makes cameo this film, just she did another bad film such \"The Sweetest Thing\" where the story treats gross humor like another plot, instead device much like this disaster.. you pass \"Slackers\" your local video store, just keep walking, and let end the bottom the shelf like deserves.,\n Jonathan Demme's directorial debut for Roger Corman's legendary exploitation outfit New World Pictures rates highly one the finest chicks-in-chains 70's grindhouse classics ever grace celluloid. Beauteous Russ Meyer starlet Eric (\"Vixen,\" \"Beyond the Valley the Dolls\") Gavin gives robust, winning performance brassy, resilient new fish who does her best persevere grimy, hellish penitentiary. The always fabulous Barbara Steele offers deliciously wicked portrayal the mean, crippled, sexually frustrated warden (her erotic dream about doing slow, steamy striptease front the lady inmates real dilly). Longtime favorite 70's B-movie actress Roberta (\"The Arousers,\" \"Unholy Rollers\") Collins delivers hilariously raunchy and endearing turn cheerfully forward, foul-mouthed kleptomaniac felon who tells gut-busting dirty joke about Pinnochio. Lynda Gold (a.k.a. Crystin Sinclaire Tobe Hooper's \"Eaten Alive\" and Curtis Harrington's \"Ruby\") makes her lively film debut uninhibited wildcat Crazy Alice. And the ever-cuddly Cheryl \"Rainbeaux\" Smith does lovely, touching reprise her fragile frightened innocent role from \"Lemora: Child's Tale the Supernatural.\"   Although this picture does deliver the expected ample amount coarse language, nudity, rape and violence, it's still means typically crass and sexist piece lurid mindless filth; the movie very effectively explores the many ways which men cruelly exploit women and strongly asserts the pro-feminist notion that women can overcome any obstacles they band together into group they can bravely face their misogynistic oppressors one mighty fighting force. Demme's zesty, confidant direction comes through with glorious abundance astutely observed incidental details and delightful moments engagingly quirky human behavior. Furthermore, both Tak Fujimoto's vibrant cinematography and John Cale's marvelously dolorous oddball blues score are 100% the money excellent. Patrick Wright (Sheriff Mack the uproariously awful cheap-rubber-monster-suit creature feature howler \"Track the Moonbeast\") has sidesplitting bit jerky cop who has his car stolen trio prison escapees when stops gas station use the bathroom. Lively, rousing and immensely enjoyable, \"Caged Heat\" qualifies absolutely essential viewing for 70's drive-in movie fans.,\n just don't understand why this movie getting beat-up here. Jeez. mindless, isn't polished and (as reading) wasted some. The cast this movie plays their characters the 'T' (If you watched Permanent Midnight and became Ben Stiller fan then yes you will disappointed). These are misunderstood, well-intentioned misfits trying save the city/world with nothing but grit and determination. The problem they don't realize their limits until the big showdown and that's the point! This times the movie that The Spy Who Shagged was yet gets panned the same demographic group, likely the same people who feel the first movie pales comparison the sequel. just don't get it. The jokes work more then one level; you didn't get know what level you're at.,\n I've been watching this movie hoping find pretty and interesting story yet the story line wasn't good all. The play the actors weren't any better.  Of course Shahrukh Khan was there yet wasn't enough make this movie \"credible\" and interesting.  I've read that this movie was based the novel Flaubert \"Madame Bovary\" yet for didn't see matching with the Indian mentality.  In general buy movie dream and have good time, not waste our time and change our mood into worse. just can't understand how could get such \"high\" vote with average 6.8/10.  So it's the kind movie you should run away ignore because there nothing appreciate it! You will just waste your time unless you like \"dark movie\" with \"strange and non sense story\".,\n This first animated film that I've ever seen. Usually, the look other animated films made reticent see them. Not Ice Age. wanted see the moment saw the trailer with Scrat, the hilarious sabertooth squirrel.  Ice Age was sporadically funny and overall fun film watch. The story basically animated version Three Men and Baby, set 20,000 years the past. The visuals were great. Simply beautiful. It's one thing create convincing aninmation, it's another thing altogether create visually arresting stuff and Ice Age great look with its stylized visuals. Blue Sky Studios company look out for the future.,\n The tourist season has just ended remote island off the coast Scotland, winter beginning set and the inhabitants, both humans and sheep alike are settling down much quieter times ahead. Michael Gaffikin (James Warwick) former paratrooper the British Army, the local dentist, he's not islander birth and such his relationship with local artist and cartographer Fiona Patterson (Celia Imrie) always being viewed with little suspicion, not maliciously, but just out the protective instincts the tight knit community have for their kin. The islands serenity broken when Gaffikin out for solitary round golf finds the headless remains brutally slain woman. immediately reports his gruesome find Insp Inskip(Maurice Roëves) the islands police station, Inskip arranges for delivery the remains local GP, Goudry, for closer inspection. quick search for the killer proves fruitless, does search for missing local woman. Over dinner that night with Michael Gaffikin, Fiona realises that the dead woman might Sheila Anderson, woman from the mainland, who lives the island through the winter months. quick search her home Dove Cottage reveals the missing remains her body, her home proving the murder scene, but why did the killer drag her torso over mile into the woods? Suspicion immediately falls the one stranger left the island, one Colonel Howard (Jonathan Newth)who also happened the last person see her alive they came across the last ferry together.  Goudry asks Gaffikin for some dental expertise the victims body, reveals that she had been torn apart somebody something with great strength, one set teeth marks the body seem point human killer, another points that unknown animal some kind. sheep found mutilated and then Canadian ornithologist found slain. With heavy fog rolling in, the island cut off from the mainland and any possibility help, the radio also doesn't work, seemingly being blocked and the phone lines have been cut. Reports UFO's and the sighting camouflaged soldier are compounded the finding odd looking craft hidden behind rocks the beach. Inskip confused and refuses listen anything but the facts and laughs off Gaffikin's idea that aliens might involved, but rise radioactive levels the island, has him doubting himself.  The Nightmare Man based the novel, Child the Vodyanoi David Wiltshire, here adapted Who and Blake's scriptwriter Robert Holmes and directed Douglas Camfield who also had directing experience both Sci/Fi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts board. The Nightmare Man though the whole, succinctly better crafted piece, that builds its plot alongside solid character development, even down the minor characters, time given giving them all firm background. The island setting perhaps genre cliché that has been used over and over, but its one that enjoy very much, the remoteness, the sense being under siege with way out always add the atmosphere and here given extra oomph having impenetrable fog close hamper all efforts. many genre efforts this kind very easy for proceedings get silly and for the plot resort melodrama, but credit Camfield, holds all together with the emphasis being believability all times. There authenticity about proceedings, the characters even speaking Gaelic times further this point. there one negative about the killer its that, are given his/her/its POV for the killings, acceptable cliché its own, but when seen through red filter and fish eye lens, just screams overkill and dates the film just little. Still though you will hard pressed guess the outcome the identity for that matter the species the killer, given the clues presented, but it's fun and very well acted piece. The local Scottish cast are exceptional, the local bobbies Roeves and Cosmo particular spar well off each other and are delight behold. Imrie, never one i've taken other works, also pretty good and displays hew womanly physique she were Hammer production. The outlandish, maybe even preposterous ending may irk some viewers, disappointed some ways, but taking into account when was made, its understandable and acceptable addendum that you think about it, even more terrifying.,\n the face film about women wanting see football match wouldn't appeal much somebody with little interest football such myself however this isn't about football about discrimination and the women's enthusiasm for the sport they love.  The film opens the day crucial World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain, girl trying get Tehran's Azadi Stadium dressing like boy, looks like she will get until soldier tries search her. Once caught she taken small enclosure high the outside the stadium where there are handful women who had already been caught, here they are guarded small group conscript soldiers who's leader would rather back home tending his livestock. never learn the character's names but get know them people the girls plead with the guards let them watch though nearby gap the wall and when refused try get them least provide commentary.  As well making important point about the rigid gender segregation much present day Iran the film contains many hilarious moments such the \"disguise\" one the girls made wear when going the toilet and the girl who disguised herself soldier and was only caught because she chose watch the match from seat reserved for senior officer. The girls enthusiasm for the game such that the end the viewer likely the edge their seat hoping that Iran will win and thus get the finals Germany. The soldiers aren't shown fundamentalists, they are just conscripts who are there because they have and when explaining the girls why woman can't watch men's sports don't seem that convinced their own arguments.  It shame that this film can't seen Iran itself but good that the wider world can see and thus see that ordinary Iranians aren't bunch fanatics desperate wage war the west but normal people with the same passions and concerns people everywhere. The cast did great job making their characters seem like real people rather than mere caricatures.,\n This has one favourite movies all time. The dialogue, with the constant use puns very tight, the cast are superb, and the plot highly original.  Don't take word for watch this movie and enjoy for yourself.,\n executive, very successful his professional life but very unable his familiar life, meets boy with down syndrome, escaped from residence Both characters feel very alone, and the apparently less intelligent one will show the executive the beauty the small things life... With this argument, the somehow Amelie-like atmosphere and the sentimental music, didn't expect but moralistic disgusting movie. Anyway, there were some interesting scenes (the boy sometimes quite violent guy), and the interpretation both actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne, was very good, decided watching the movie. The French cinema, general, has the ability showing something that seems quite much life, opposed the more stereotyped American cinema. But, because that, much more disappointing see after the absurd ending, with the impossible death the boy, the charming tone, the happiness the executive's family, the cheap moral, the unbearable laughter the daughters, the guy waving from heaven Michael Landon... Really nasty, humble opinion.,\n After finally viewing this movie its entirety, completely mystified the adoration has received critics and online users alike. the worst Western ever? No, wouldn't say that. But \"the last great American Western\", phrase saw applied more than once? Not even close.  A movie that tries tell story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue, and the dialogue this film among the most hackneyed and clichéd that I've ever seen. The movie can measured groaners per minute; in, how many times actor actress forced the script say something that human being would say real life? There's many instances this that it's distracting. Cheesy lines come you waves; predictable, unoriginal, and often.   If bad dialogue doesn't bother you, then how about bad gunfights? Few Westerns can show you gunfighting that's completely unbelievable while desperately trying make you take the action seriously. It's okay there's comic edge such gunfighting, such Silverado, but Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography the early gunplay just another reason leave this movie off the list good Westerns. The final showdown somewhat redeems the director this score, but then, was disinterested the movie that was beyond saving.  Other than those flaws, can say the visuals are stunning the movie's well shot and the settings all look great. The acting passable, especially considering what the actors were given work with. However, you're looking for the last great American Western, yourself favor rent Unforgiven instead.  3 out,\n First all, would just like say everyone who has seen this movie, that the actor who played the \"Transvestite\" one friends, his name Robert Dugdale, he's terrific actor, although doesn't say much about his filmography, he's been several plays and musicals. currently residing Terrace B.C. that where from, comes over our house almost every saturday *laughs* Okay, now about the movie, wouldn't recomend this anyone who HASN'T seen it, for not movie worth watching, the main reason found bad movie never stays place, keeps bouncing back between time, kinda hard follow some points, and second, its really boring *laughs* Although the acting great, the movie just doesn't compare.,\n Somewhere near the bottom the film studio ladder you can find companies like U.F.O, Troma and beneath them lie Seduction cinema.  Seduction direct video production company that specialize lesbian themed, non-hardcore erotic movies. has developed very dedicated fan base that purchase each new title they are released but sadly the company has become too closely associated with frequent star Misty Mundae. say sadly because recent mainstream interest and her appearance the show Masters Horrors has caused her set her sights little higher than the zero budget S.C efforts which forces the company find new identity. But back their glory days they released this film very appreciative world.  The gorgeous Misty Mundae forced attend boarding school the request absent father. the school she meets her absurdly hot room-mate played Ruby Larocca who immediately has designs her but the headmistress (Barbara Joyce) has other plans. typical S.C style the movie stops every ten minutes for extended sex scene but unlike most their efforts this one has somewhat interesting story and couple good performances. Ms. Larocca appears having great time the sexual predator who views Misty tasty meal and Darian Caine makes welcome (though brief) appearance Satan. This the sort film that Jess Franco would crank out the 70s (although this one does not have the hardcore sex that Franco was always willing throw for foreign sales) and fans that madman's work would wise give this one go.  To me, long time zero budget cinema fan (and Troma worshiper), came across the Seduction cinema films through their parody films (Playmate the apes, Who wants erotic billionaire) but actually prefer their more original works. You either see past the low budget and occasionally weak acting you get hung these things and just hate all these films. For the most obvious thing that unites these no-budget movies real sense fun. These low budget companies are able create their own unique style which gives the viewer something very different from the bland, the numbers, studio efforts that load the multiplexes.  If you have never seen Seduction cinema film either this Sin Sisters (featuring both the Mundae sisters) are excellent choices begin with. This one fun, fast paced film (although the frequent exterior shots the school get little old) and the DVD totally loaded with extras including ton previews other company offerings, great behind the scenes featurette and some deleted scenes including alternate opening. recommend you pass the disc's bonus feature, the first film director, quite weak and not really worth viewing.,\n This dumb comedy really does good job wasting comedic talent. particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are misused badly here. might have chuckled once twice during this film, but general, it's boring movie, with little bit stupidity thrown for good measure. The premise, although routine, still wasn't bad, but once the plot was set, the film went nowhere. Don't waste your time with this misfire.,\n Why didn't the producers give that show chance all the junk TV, why didn't the producers give Six Degrees chance? Will the series video? would love see how ends. Put season one video and sell it. was loyal fan Six Degrees and waited for it's return. set recorder tape all the shows. Thank God for that. just found out that the show was canceled and I'm heart broken. wish knew was going canceled, why didn't they tell us? thought the show was just developing some depth the characters. The writing was pretty good also. Steven (Campbell Scott) all time favorite. sorry see go!,\n This film was shot location Gerard Gardens Liverpool, and was the UK's answer films such 'Blackboard Jungle'. The film stands the test time quite well, with all the moral stories still (or even more) relevant today. The film feature some fine performance from some notable British actors such David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. Baker plays Liverpool cop assigned juvenile liaison duties, with the premise that you catch the kids early age, they will end being responsible adults.  Notable cameos the film include Freddie Starr (Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play brother and sister (they are real life brother and sister) who are caught arsonists web. Tsai Chin still acting and can seen the latest Nicole Kidman film 'The Interpretor'.  Violent Playground features gun siege school, unlikely shown following similar events Scotland Russia.  I lived Gerard Gardens where the film was shot (though was not born the time), and have fond memories the area. have recently completed documentary Gerard Gardens which includes extracts from 'Violent Playground', and small film 'Coast Coast' which stars Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite. The tenements were demolished 1987 and the films some way keeping the memory alive.  There were some complaints from the residents when the film was released, the film portrayed the area bad light. Time has helped heal those wounds.  A little gem film, would recommend you seek this out,\n the early 1970s, many who had embraced hippy/acid/alternative culture wholeheartedly, had realised that mainstream society was not going change the way thought would. For this film defined the tension \"now what?\" that many the people knew felt that time. head for the commune and create our own vision utopia radicalize and push for change?  From the futile gestures police, the radical rhetoric, the music Pink Floyd, the love-making and the explosive images the desert much there. captures well significant moment time.,\n Maybe it's the dubbing, maybe it's the endless scenes people crying, moaning otherwise carrying on, but found Europa '51 one the most overwrought (and therefore annoying) films I've ever seen. The film starts out promisingly familiarly, mom Ingrid Bergman too busy spend time with her spoiled brat son (Sandro Franchina). Whilst mummy and daddy (bland Alexander Knox) entertain their guests dinner party, the youngster tries kill himself, setting motion life changing series events that find Bergman spending time showering compassion the poor and needy. Spurred Communist newspaper editor Andrea (Ettore Giannini), she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband, who soon locks her insane asylum for her troubles. Bergman plays the saint role the hilt, echoing her 1948 role Joan Arc, and Rossellini does fantastic job lighting and filming her best effect. Unfortunately, the script pounds its point home with ham-fisted subtlety, Andrea and Mom take turns declaiming Marxist and Christian platitudes. the final tear soaked scene, had had more than fill these tiresome characters. real step down for Rossellini stepped away from neo-realism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes 1950's Flowers St. Francis.,\n This another example sucky sequel great movie. highly recommend The Prophecy, but this movie was dud from the start. The acting was decent all the way around, but the story line was weak and added nothing the origional. out best.,\n This movie really not all that bad. But then again, this movie genre right down alley. Sure, the sets are cheap, but they really did decent with what they had.   If you like cheap, futuristic, post-apocalyptic movies, then you'll love this one!! sure did! <br,\n never expect film adaptation follow too closely the novel (especially beloved one, like Evening) but when saw that the book's author, Susan Minot, was screenplay writer and executive producer the film, thought that Evening would good adaptation.  If you enjoyed the book, don't bother with this movie. far afield the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance one another.  Here, our characters are completely different: the bride love with Harris. Harris the son the housekeeper. Buddy drunk, love with Ann and/or Harris. don't think single character made from the book the screen; just gets worst with every passing moment.  And, really, didn't learn from Bridges Madison County that cutting from the story are meant enthralled in, scenes our heroes' grown children having obnoxious and juvenile fights, simply does not work film? This film disaster. Skip it.,\n This one the weirder movies have recently watched. That's because seems less like movie and more like experimental film. Kurasawa's experiment was take variety individuals who live garbage dump and weave their experiences into tapestry that offers glimpses their generally harsh existences. Not every episode depressing and harsh, but overall this definitely the tone. Let's see,...we have case incest/rape, attempted murder, wife swapping, alcoholism, infidelity, death little boy after eating tainted fish, man with severe depression (he never talks during the movie and looks very scary), hopeless dreamer who would probably diagnosed with schizophrenia, mentally retarded young man who thinks street car conductor and spends all his waking moments \"driving\" his street car through paths among the garbage piles, man married total shrew think liked her character even less than the incestuous rapist!), etc., etc. fact, depressing enough that seemed almost like Ingmar Bergman movie set Japan, Bergman made MANY movies that tended deal with mental illness and the hopelessness life. any wonder that after making this film Kurasawa tried kill himself?! So, did like it? No. was not fun experience. But, was very well-made movie that definitely kept attention and result, really wanted see what happened these people. was sort like watching train wreck--you don't WANT see all the carnage but you can't help but watch! all the vignettes, think that the older man who tended look out for everyone and who didn't really seem fit (he was too well-adjusted and wise living garbage dump) was perhaps meant represent Kurasawa himself. Maybe. dunno.  If you've seen variety Kurasawa films and have high tolerance for strange art films, give this one watch. However, NOT make this your first experience watching his movies--it's sure scare away many viewers!,\n Somewhere his non-fiction book DANSE MACABRE, Stephen King suggests that one secret writing scary stories avoid showing your readers exactly what horrible thing waiting behind the door get them. last the door bursts open and bug ten feet tall lurches through, the reader may little scared, but he'll also think, \"Well, can deal with that. least wasn't HUNDRED feet tall.\" There's nothing more frightening than what lurks, unseen and unknown, just the other side that tightly closed door, waiting get you.  THE HAUNTING completely misconceived that director Jan Bont more less starts off his movie metaphorically throwing open that door himself and yelling: \"Look, everybody, look! It's ten-foot-tall bug! Isn't that SCARY?!\" The law diminishing returns immediately kicks in. the end the movie, the director is, speak, jumping and down, banging his CGI pots and pans madly, and hoarsely screaming: \"Look, everyone, look! Here come ten HUNDRED-foot-tall bugs! ... And now, here come hundred THOUSAND-foot-tall bugs!\"   The filmmakers apparently believed that special effects alone could compensate for all the other shortcomings this endeavor (and there are many). They can't and don't. fact, impressive they are, the special effects are insistent and obtrusive that the distracted viewer winds staring them whether admiration annoyance instead being immersed story.  For me, the nadir this film's sheer stupidity comes when statue, with \"blood\" gushing from its mouth, tries drown Liam Neeson (as Dr. Marrow) fountain. The filmmakers clearly didn't know what with this alleged idea once they had it, they just have Neeson thrash around the water bit, flailing his arms and going glug-glug. the next scene, the good doctor has apparently dried himself off and, hum, forgotten all about the annoying incident.  Shirley Jackson's novel seems have been dumbed-down into this ridiculous screenplay committee low-IQ teenage stoners who thought the way frighten people was make every effect bigger and louder: \"Okay, next, let's, uh, make the ceiling, you know, look like creepy face, and, uh, come down her ... and all these spiky things, like, trap her the bed.\"  The sole saving grace THE HAUNTING that last becomes awful that it's actually funny. the time Owen Wilson (as Luke Sanderson) fell the floor and then went his Magic-Carpet Ride Death, just about fell the floor myself, laughing.  Badly constructed, witless, grotesquely heavy-handed, utterly unbelievable, and filled with clunky dialogue and pointless scenes, this vacuous HAUNTING textbook example how NOT make horror movie.,\n Given the opposite circumstance 2009 where the reality have black president, this movie takes quite powerful historical significance. For entertainment value found this movie both engaging and repugnant. was quite taken back course the blatant racism the time, but also found the music and dancing incredible. Also quite cool see Sammy Davis such very young child actor. plays Rufus Jones, young boy who being consoled his Mammy. told 'Why some day you could President'. This was ridiculous 1933 that was mocked and thought endearing, charming and funny. The bulk the movie fantasy sequence what the government would like was run black man. They depict the seats government being like revivalist Baptist church.  The fact was when stumbled onto this movie one day drew in. really well done and very entertaining. believe can look beyond the racism can see this movie for all brings us. fact realize that not only not ridiculous have black president, but that normal, just makes this movie that much more relevant. clearly marks moment time for our collective consciousness.,\n Let start out saying will try not put too many spoilers this. Normally enjoy Robin Williams movies, however this gem was not one them. was billed suspenseful thriller. The night listener was anything but. blunt there were people the theater opening day, walked out, for good reason. The movie was opinion poorly written and directed. The acting was alright but again there wasn't anything work with. The movie about storyteller who reads good book dying kid. However *insert spooky here* one can verify the kids existence. Williams goes Wisconsin try and find the author, however all gets headache and excuses from the boys caretaker. There thats it, thats all. You wait for about hour and half and movie ends. had many thrills and chills dentist office visit. The homosexual undertones, overtones had really nothing with the story, and the movie had little profanity but seemed thrown there for absolutely reason and made little sense. conclusion really can't write decent review this film because there was nothing it, was captivating watching paint dry. gave because the acting for what was worth was alright and wasn't directed Uwe Boll.,\n Five years after the original Creepshow, another inferior horror sequel penned George Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow This time there are only three stories instead five. None the three stories really original distinguished either. The first story horror staple, formulaic story about wooden Indian statue seeking revenge against the killers its owners. The effects are really neat this story, but it's just too familiar compelling enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the elderly store owners. The second story, \"The Raft\", Stephen King story. It's about four teenagers that unwittingly spend the day wooden pallet the middle isolated lake. Soon the kids are screaming for their lives watery blob does each them for apparent reason. However, instead being suspenseful, the kids are saddled with bad dialog and dopey-headed behavior, preventing from really caring about what happens next. There also some unintentional humor this segment. The third and final story \"The Hitch-hiker\", which actually retread re-adapted for Creepshow The original story, Lucille Fletcher, was filmed 1953 film noir suspense film. Then was adapted for famous Twilight Zone episode featuring Inger Stevens. \"The Hitch-hiker\" works the best out these three offerings, but it's not without its problems either. Lois Chiles plays cheating spouse, who ends running over hitch-hiker, she thinks. However, don't know whether sympathize with her condemn her. many average stories this type, the characters exist merely tell the stories with their twists and turns. The wrap around story with the bullies seems bit out place. Tom Savini appears the \"creep\" this installment. The good thing there haven't been any more sequels. *1/2 stars.,\n Watching this was like getting large mackerel slapped your face over and over again. Even when you thought, \"That mackerel surely can't coming around again,\" *slap* there was. I'm not sure what they were thinking. This the sort pilot watched and wondered, \"Did the actors know they were doomed ship destined never made into series?\" Not only black stereotypes but Swedish and Indian ones well. And while \"Blazing Saddles\" made these stereotypes into mix comedy and uncomfortableness, these stereotypes were just downright offensive. There was plot line, the ending was slapped on, and the jokes aren't. Still, you are student comedy, watch this pilot see what you shouldn't do.,\n had never heard this film until came across accident when browsing IMDB. saw had gotten many awful reviews containing very colorful expletives how much stunk. course this meant had see it. was pleasantly surprised Whipped actually rather good movie. watched with group friends and laughed more than had many recent highly acclaimed Hollywood fluff comedies. This independent film and such portrays its subject matter (sex and dating) without the usual Hollywood fakery. distinctly suspect that people's opinion this film will depend very much their experience life. you've never dated partied much you won't get this movie because you won't have met people like these characters. you have, you'll recognize many the situations that portrayed here comedic fashion. The ending was also good, did not portray women unreal, helpless, virginal romantics contrast many Hollywood movies.,\n This was one the most boring movies I've ever seen don't really know why Just your run-of-the-mill stories about guy who about get married, and starts fancy someone else instead. Story has been told thousand times. Nothing new innovative about all.  I don't really know what was wrong with this film. Most the time when these kinds actors/actresses get together make film that have already been made million times before, it's really entertaining. There are usually little clever thing them that aren't really any other. For some reason, this one just doesn't hold your attention. You can pick out some funny parts, clever ideas it, but for some reason they're just not funny, nor clever any way wish new how explain it, but don't Just don't waste your time this one,\n Yeah sure it's cheesy, it's not Zombie, but it's not that bad either. has Beatrice Ring which huge bonus, and it's entertaining. had the good fortune meet Fulci later his career and remained philosophical about the experience, was never completely satisfied with it. well worth search out, especially for genre and Fulci fans. film that far too often dismissed out hand.,\n This entertaining \"history\" the FBI, but should viewed fiction, because that's exactly what is. What else could when Edgar Hoover personally approved and had cameo role the production. James Stewart excellent, usual, and the supporting cast, except for the talentless Vera Miles, good. Murray Hamilton especially good supporting role Stewart's partner and best friend. The FBI accomplishments that the film highlights are undoubtedly all true. What significant what leaves out.  One the most shameful parts the film the depiction the killing John Dillinger. portrayed pretty much happened, but mention all made Melvin Purvis, the Chicago Bureau Chief who headed the operation. Instead, the operation depicted the fictional Chip Hardesty were running it. has been said that Hoover was jealous the publicity that Purvis received after Dillinger was killed; Purvis was subsequently transferred remote outpost, and shortly afterward left the FBI. This doubt why Purvis was never mentioned the film. But this viewer, least, paused think that Purvis was treated this way, what about all the agents who conducted all the other operations depicted the film. Were they also completely ignored and replaced the fictional Hardesty.  The film probably accurate its portrayal FBI activity through the end WWII. However, after that point, the film would have believe that the only threat facing the came from international communism, which doubt what Hoover believed. Never mind the Mafia. Never mind the lynchings that were still going the South. Never mind that blacks were being intimidated keep them from voting much the South. don't know the FBI had started wiretapping Martin Luther King the time this film was made, but not, wasn't very long afterward that started.  As said the outset, this pretty good entertainment, but should viewed the sanitized fictionalization that is.,\n Although properly warned actually sat down watch this movie. part because usually give every movie even break, and because thought that single movie couldn't that bad. stand corrected. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick Ben Stein could save this turkey from sinking like ton bricks. Only once during this humor forsaken travesty spoof did laugh. Namely during the Simon says scene. The other jokes are either poorly carried out simply plain unfunny. And some them you actually see coming mile away. This movie just hasn't got what takes good parody like Airplane! (I+II), Naked Gun (I+II+III), Scary Movie. They all had funny gags, good dialog and most important all unforgettable quotes. Men White has got none the above. call this movie bad would gross understatement. AVOID THIS MOVIE ANYWAY YOU CAN! CONSIDER YOURSELVES WARNED!,\n memorable line from short lived show.

Her father (Eugene Palette) determined stop the marriage and has her kidnapped pilot Steve Collins (James Cagney. Seriously). They crash land the desert and hate each other but (sigh) start falling love.  This seems getting high rating from reviewers here only because Cagney and Davis are it. They were both brilliant actors but they were known for dramas NOT comedy and this movie shows why! The script just horrible--there's not one genuine laugh the entire movie. The running joke this has Cagney and Davis falling rump first cactus (this done THREE TIMES!). Only their considerable talents save them from being completely humiliated. they both their best with the lousy material. Cagney tries his best with his lines and Davis screeches every line full force but doesn't work. Carson has this \"what the hell\" look his face throughout the entire movie (probably because his characters emotions change seconds). Only Palette with his distinctive voice and over the top readings manges elicit few smiles. But, all all, this was dull and laughless--a real chore sit through. This gets two stars only for Cagney and Davis' acting and some beautiful cinematography but really--it's not worth seeing. Cagney and Davis hated this film later years and you can see why.,\n But the rest us, who love good sentimental and emotional story that lock get you crying..enjoy!   Tom Hulce magnificent Dominick, mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother, Eugene, played Ray Liotta, who doctor and who works very long hours.   Due Eugene's work schedule, Dominick alone lot the time and tends make questionable judgment calls. really just wants good boy, the right thing, and make his brother proud him. stops church pray one point and expresses his emotions openly and well that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started.   Not about give anything away here, but the movie extremely involving and sad and heartbreaking. Those unafraid these things will have field day with this beautiful story, its loving characters and great song cannot quote here, that has nothing with the movie all but strangely appropriate..but you hear bar.  I thought Tom Hulce would nominated for this movie, since was for 'Amadeus' figured that might give him the inside track actually winning. such luck. Liotta just good but has less emotional impact, but then does later on. All can say about Jamie Lee Curtis that she doesn't have much part here but was nice her lend her name small drama set Pittsburgh about two brothers who you will never forget.,\n What crime...  You forgot brush your teeth...let's make minute show about and have couple kids make some noise and then have the dad lecture them all because that's what has do.  But, don't forget Uncle Joey has make some weird noises and cooky faces, then Uncle Jesse has show with his black leather jacket and some jeans and look pretty for few minutes while everybody discusses how Mother would have done things she were around..  Yep, full zany little adventures about whole bunch nothing and entire overlong story build around it.  Full House will not only bore you tears, but will make you age twenty times faster than you normally would.,\n very ordinary made-for-tv product, \"Tyson\" attempts serious biopic while stretching the moments angst for effect, fast forwarding through the esoterics the corrupt sport boxing, and muddling the sensationalistic stuff which the only thing which makes Tyson even remotely interesting. lukewarm watch best which more likely appeal the general public than boxing fans.,\n This film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. was sort remake but then again, not really. was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has his disposal. had great make and CGI available and lots money ($100 million) but can you honestly say that what got was good the original film that was made for less than million? Heck no. that regard, the film fails.  At least the original film, the statue liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking this film even the end scene because you could kind see coming. And, the way, you give some thought, and did, you can figure out how the ending could come about. just wish had back the time that wasted thinking about it.  This film would have been brilliant and fun stayed along the lines the first film and adopted part \"Beneath the Planet the Apes\". Here's how would have written it:  An astronaut (it really should have been more than Marky Mark because he's not good enough care film all himself would have put three guys) that would land what they would think would another planet, encounter humans (not mutes), city ruled apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they're earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then....well, let your imagination run wild how you want end it.  But point that there could have been much more this film. Sadly, Tim Burton really knows how wreck good thing. Consider what did with the Batman series. He's rotten director inspite what people think. He's trendy must good goes the thinking. Sorry, but no. anyone else had done this film, would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying.,\n Really, think this movie more example easy target than truly bad film. fact, the movie done very well many respects and very entertaining.  Yes, the script little convoluted, but that's the genre. The film has noirish atmosphere centered around femme fatale. Just like all the old noir classics, this, too, has screenplay that twists you around that you don't always know how make sense first, and can stretch you think too deeply and try put all the pieces together. That's the genre. general, the script has enough surprises and turns keep the viewer guessing and, turn, surprised, without abandoning the viewer.  Sharon Stone also easy target. The truth she looks great and she speaks her double-entendre laden dialog such way zhuzh into something mysterious, sexy and fun.  The direction more than passable, because let's face it--you have keep audience interested the \"did she didn't she?\" question for two hours. addition twisty script and fun performance Stone, this done effectively through the direction the creation noirish atmosphere that both dark and very stark and modern the same time, with straight industrial lines along with Stone's sexy curves. The frame always beautiful--press pause anywhere and there something interesting the eye.  The film also effectively builds things that were gimmicks the first film and turns them into something little more real, particularly the sex. \"Katherine Tramell bisexual...how shocking!\" becomes treated more matter-of-factly here, and typically, the sexuality the film used better effect. still titillating, but not done readily for shock value and buzz done the first. won't say that isn't still somewhat gimmick because, let's face it, this film supposed fun.  And fun film is. may easy target, but you watch for what is: noirish, femme-fatale driven, twisty, sexy, did-she-or-didn't-she who-dunnit, you're bound enjoy (no pun intended).,\n Even this film was allegedly joke response critics it's still awful film. one going commit that sort thing least make good joke.....first off, Jeroen Krabbé guess the poor man's Gerard Depardieu.....naturally hate Gerard Depardieu even though was very funny the 'Iron Mask' three musketeer one. Otherwise box office poison and Jeroen Krabbé worse than that. The poor man's box office poison....really that not being fair the economically disenfranchised. the '4th Man' supposed some sort critique the Bourgeoisie....what saying? isn't. Let's just say hypothetically, was supposed be, wasn't sharp enough. Satire tricky thing....if isn't sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt the joke instead......i think that what happened. The story just ends bunch miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not interesting way either.....(for more interesting and worthwhile application see any Luis Bunuel film....very sharp satire)  [potential spoiler alert]  Really, the blow job the cemetery that Jeroen Krabbé's character works hard attain.... you even care? funny? since Mr. Voerhoven supposed good film maker will give him the benefit the doubt and assume was some misanthropic joke that got out control.....though i'm guessing didn't cast Jeroen Krabbé because he's the worst actor and every character he's played has been pretentious bourgeois ass.... except he's incompetent it. becomes like weird caricature. you think Mr. Voerhoven did that purpose? and Jeroen Krabbé the butt the joke well? just don't see it...... you understand the dilemma i'm faced with here right? the worst film ever because he's supposed good director. there some kind dupery involved. knew 'Patch Adams' was horrible without even seeing it. not duped 'The 4th Man\"s deceptively alluring packaging mr. Voerhoven's reputation good director etc. etc.,\n don't even think about renting this from the shops, because this one hell bad movie. You'd think that Abrahams had written this movie. Basically, rat flushed down the toilet and somehow has get back out. Fans the completely terrible \"Shrek\" might enjoy, but \"Wallace Gromit\" fans will probably turn away disgust. Also, why didn't they plasticine clay? mean, CGI animation?? For AARDMAN movie??!! Obviously, Aardman lazed around while they let Dreamworks the whole thing. Wrong, wrong, WRONG!!! Nearly every single character awful, apart from that freaky frog guy, who just right for movie villain. But everything else about the movie DULL, DULL, DULL!!! almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie. No, wait, actually, DID fall asleep with boredom watching this movie. It's just terrible. But thankfully, it's not bad \"Shrek.\",\n first saw this film when was about 13. blew away then and many respects still does now. But less inclined see accurate historical piece now. There precious little effort made examine and interact with the racism and thus fails recognise that the most potent anti racism weapon understand its very core those who commit it. What get instead dichotomy the one side, beko and woods panoramic rainbow vision the other, two dimensional characters are portrayed unapologetic unthinking evil.  This all makes for great film story, but worries that people see the portrayal 'accurate'.,\n Very rarely does Denzil Washington make bad movie and come think that goes for Kevin Kline and this case this must count one their best films. more about film about how strong friendship can more than the story Steve Biko although get insight into what the man was like and how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods went preserve the mans name and let the world know what corrupt putrid society South Africa was. The Direction outstanding from David Attenborough was for Gandhi although there any critisism aimed could the length the film. Two and half hours long time sit through historic movie .What amazing how manages control all the extras. Thousands people both films. This film really does open your eyes what happened before the break Aparthiet and you cannot fail moved it. out 10.,\n \"Read Lips (Sur mes lèvres)\" (which probably has different idiomatic resonance its French title) nifty, twisty contemporary tale office politics that unexpectedly becomes crime caper the unusually matched characters slide and down ethical and sensual slippery slope.  The two leads are magnetic, Emmanuelle Devos (who I've never seen before despite her lengthy resume French movies) and even more disheveled than usual Vincent Cassel (who has brought sexy and/or threatening look and voice some movies).  The first half the movie her turf competitive real estate office and he's the neophyte. The second half his turf ex-con and her wrenching adaptation that milieu.  Writer/director Jacques Audiard very cleverly uses the woman's isolating hearing disability entrée for into her perceptions, turning the sound and down for hear she does (so it's even more annoying than usual when audience members talk), using visuals sensory reactors well.  None the characters act anticipated (she not like that pliable victim from \"In the Company Men,\" not individual interactions, not scenes, and not the overall arc the unpredictable story line (well, until the last shot, but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment) move from hectic modern office, hectic disco romantic and criminal stake-outs.   There side story that's thematically redundant and unnecessary, but that just gives few minutes catch our breaths.  This one favorites the year!   (originally written 7/28/2002),\n Before seeing this movie, was expecting fictional drama based loosely ideas from the book; instead, it's the book, interrupted with dramatic scenes illustrating the different \"illnesses.\" That didn't bother much, but hindered enjoyment the film. One story even two three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed through the movie would have been preferable, opinion. you're going base movie psychology text, you've got find more interesting (and preferably accurate) text than this one. The film drags during parts where it's little more than video encyclopedia 19th century sexual psychology and would utterly intolerable weren't sexual nature (because \"sex interesting\" for most us, even me). Luckily, there are several stories with actual character development that pull in.  But, disappointingly, Krafft-Ebing's theories sexuality went unchallenged, for the most part. was hoping would use stories show how the imperfections his archaic view psychology which still held many this day.  So, the end, what you have? detailed catalog few fetishes and orientations, with some mildly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations few \"sexual deviants\" before they are cured. For most the film, the film moves with the crawling speed (and mood) wake. And, obviously low budget film, the cinematography and acting are not exactly top tier. Although *was* pleased with the music, costume and interior design.  I felt this film's subject was right alley, and still feel it's below average film. deserves 3/10; 4/10 were feeling extremely generous. can't imagine anyone enjoying this they didn't already have interest sexual fetishism.,\n watched the show years ago and loved it!!! now possession the DVD and was watching the series, and waiting for scenes knew were the show (when Lucas confronts Gail his house)and realized was missing all sudden was watching the seduction without the lead up. Then went line check out all the BIOS the stars and came across the comments about the shows being out order. Thank You!!!!! But there seems some conflict. Some comments state \"Strangler number then Triangle 20, when another had them around the other way. And also Potato Boy and Dead the World were reversed well. Can someone clarify?????,\n The comment \"eliz7212-1\" hits the proverbial \"nail the head\" for this turkey program. But hoot watch William Shatner \"cavort\" and \"dance\" (yes, the marks the word dance are necessary for what Bill does). This show would great skit SNL MAD and does rate few stars for one viewing, so, see Shatner, who seems have taken \"camp\" new heights whether role himself. But the guy funny.  The girls who are the cubicle areas with the game data scrolls, will pretty much out-of-luck when this turkey canceled unless there revival the whiskey-a-go-go genre, with resurrected demand for shapely young women dance elevated cages once more.  I watched the first contestant, who was annoying, and literally \"dumber than :post,\" yet through sheer luck, walked away with quarter mil so. The second contestant, somewhat more intelligent, but who'd lucky gain $1,000 Jeopardy!, got zonked the card which requires answering special question which didn't know, and thereby left with zilch.  This plethora game shows, which dangle, and sometimes award, large sums everyday individuals, are admittedly cheap effort, overall, attempt woo viewers. Even the host well-compensated, and they give away six figures average episode, suppose that the revenue versus costs can favorable since you don't have sitcom cast where several stars are getting six seven figures, per episode, with some big residual deals well.  But suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long. This one has already pretty much reached this point. think his offerings, especially with James Spader, and the others \"Boston Legal\" should give satisfying quantity Bill Shatner's offerings.  Again, the above rating simply appropriate view Bill hoot and prance, perhaps one time; that should sufficient.,\n \"Ardh Satya\" one the finest film ever made Indian Cinema. Directed the great director Govind Nihalani, this one the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out Commercial Success. Even today, Ardh Satya inspiration for all leading directors India.  The film tells the Real-life Scenario Mumbai Police the 70s. Unlike any Police other cities India, Mumbai Police encompasses Different system altogether. Govind Nihalani creates very practical Outlay with real life approach Mumbai Police Environment.  Amongst various Police officers colleagues, the film describes the story Anand Velankar, young hot-blooded Cop coming from poor family. His father harsh Police Constable. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies incidences his father's Atrocities his mother. Anand's approach towards immediate action against crime, inert craving for his own Job satisfaction. The film here revolved Plot wherein Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled his seniors.This leads frustrations, cannot achieve the desired Job-satisfaction. Resulting from the frustrations, his anger expressed excessive violence the remand rooms bars, also turning him alcoholic.  The Spirit within him still alive, constantly fights the system. aware the system the Metro, where the Police Politicians are inertly associated far end. His compromise towards unethical practice negative. Finally gets suspended.  The Direction master piece thoroughly hard core. One the best memorable scenes when Anand breaks the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty's house arrest him, followed short conversation which fantastic. many scenes, the film has Hair-raising moments.  The Practical approach Script major Punch. Alcoholism, Corruption, Political Influence, Courage, Deceptions all are integral part Mumbai police even today. Those aspects are dealt brilliantly.  Finally, the films belongs the One man show, Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.,\n The social commentary was way overblown and the mystery itself built and solved through series implausible coincidences that were entirely unbelievable. Nothing has changed Fitz's personal life the past decade that makes remotely interesting.   I even had trouble understanding why was complaining about his stay Australia compared the opportunities solve mysteries that has England. Can not insinuate himself the Australian police? seems like very artificial plot point get him involved crime investigation.  The latter episodes the original series were pretty melodramatic and implausible, sometimes bordering silliness, and this one picks that mantle rather than returning the focus series one. Sad.,\n Tim Robbins oddly benign here, cast garage mechanic 1950s New Jersey who falls love with perky blonde who turns out Albert Einstein's niece! Although he's on-screen much the time, Robbins cancels out the inner-workings his intense persona and fades into the background (it's easy forget he's even the picture!). Lumpy romantic comedy with gimmick, that being Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what can with cartoonishly conceived character). Otherwise, it's sugary and sunny, directed rather drowsily Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but wit brains. Meg Ryan her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and Robbins charming, like that affectionate sister and her big brother. from ****,\n The story and the characters were some the best I've ever seen. the graphics were good for the and the cut scenes and voice overs were amazing. beat the game least times and loved every second it. felt the problems the protagonist faced were believable and realistic and believe deserves sequel. least remake. they remade for the ps3 would buy the system for just that game and maybe mgs4 its amazing also the idea and execution the dragoon system enough warrant rental and top that the inventive although sometimes cheating(stupid buster wand) combat addition system and the plot makes this game definite buy.,\n The first was good and original. was not bad horror/comedy movie. heard second one was made and had watch it.  What really makes this movie work Judd Nelson's character and the sometimes clever script. pretty good script for person who wrote the Final Destination films and the direction was okay. Sometimes there's scenes where looks like was filmed using home video camera with grainy-look.  Great made-for-TV movie. was worth the rental and probably worth buying just get that nice eerie feeling and watch Judd Nelson's Stanley doing what does best.  I suggest newcomers watch the first one before watching the sequel, just you'll have idea what Stanley like and get little history background.,\n not parent, neither male. But was able identify with every character's heartaches and pains.  This movie teenagers should watch. Maybe that way they will start appreciating the value family again. I'm sorry for those that don't understand the value love, family and friendship.  It was very interesting watch Patrick Duffy different role than that Bobby Ewing. And great see year old Ben Affleck giving his best moving and sincere performance. showed early age, that capable heartfelt drama. should offered more serious roles. Note Hollywoodland... his first serious role years and went out and won Best Actor the Venice Festival 2006.  This movie can appreciated people all ages. Maybe shouldn't watched children under because they might get scared that the same may happen their families, but recommend the entire family.  I bought this movie DVD and have watched with friends many times. Because portrays the values that are important life.,\n This not movie for fans the usual eerie Lynch stuff. Rather, it's for those who either appreciate good story, have grown tired the run-of-the-mill stuff with overt sentimentalism and Oprah-ish \"This such wonderful movie! You must see it!\"-semantics (tho' she right, for once!).  The story unfolds flawlessly, and are taken along journey that, believe, most will come recognize some time. compassionate, existentialist journey where make amends för our past when approaching ourt inevitable demise.  Acting without faults, cinematography likewise (occasionally quite brilliant!), and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer grasp the details the story.  A warm movie. Not excessively sentimental.,\n Some the acknowledged Altman \"masterpieces\" seem sadder now. Maybe it's me. Like the last reviewer, even like this \"lesser\" Altman (shown recently FMC), although don't think was aiming wide audience. Organization politics \"microcosm\" for public campaigns. Some this satirical \"docudrama\" now dated, like Dick Cavett watching the Tonight Show, but found much the dialog funny and insightful (e.g. \"You are for real. That means you're threat anyone\"). The story isn't \"profound,\" but liked it. And the performances are funny, especially Cavett (as \"himself\"), Lauren Bacall aging conservative figurehead, Glenda Jackson (who actually became member Parliament) left wing ideologue (in the opening scene lecturing someone dressed carrot the sanctity politics), and Carol Burnett basket case. All the inimitable Altman style, although maybe not quite inimitable usual. But pretty inimitable.,\n When first found out that Brian Krause was going this movie, wanted watch. took weeks realize that I've seen the original this and loved it. had even more reason watch. Well, watched. was actually better than most sequels for movies. hate what happens Brian's character (you can find out for yourself) and didn't like most the characters, Brian's one included. But the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerk-like characters make Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shine once more. the end, was cheering for Stanley and his own happy ending. you liked the original Cabin the Lake you like horror movies without the blood, I'd suggest you watch this.,\n really truly enjoyed this movie. (Which why surprised that got such low rating from many users this site!) not saying that cinematic masterpiece but was great way spend cold, snowy Saturday night. funny, poignant, and great tales the ups and downs female friendships lasting through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend each others! (fess ladies, have ALL BEEN THERE!) Bill Paterson shines the Reverand Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell proves that she can fine actress when the role right and she puts her mind it. (And truly, there the best \"wedding escape\" that have ever seen dreamed this film ... more guts than anyone have ever known!) You will laugh and you will cry --- ignore any marketing campaigns and how this film being marketing .... hidden gem that should have done TONNES box office. (now have look around purchase copy!),\n Woah! one thing can say about this movie. Personally I'm one those people who loves cats that would have been big down side the movie, but loved how cats from every were got their revenge the end.  I liked the movie, but have admit was because found Brian Krause who played Charles Brady very very irresistible, guess lust got the better while watching this movie.  There was one thing that was disappointed over. I've watched Charmed before and Brian Krause married Holly Marie Combs, his kissing scene was O.K. Sleepwalkers, but really bad compare his kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, don't know because Krause and Combs have great chemistry maybe more bit more, that was the only disappointment the movie but guess was made for with Brian Krause those tight ass jeans was wearing the movie.  If you are use seeing Brian Krause Holly Marie Combs heavenly husband and the father her son your for big surprise with this movie, was nothing like angle boy. Although now that think about it, would great see Krause's character Charmed taken over evil making him something like his was Sleepwalkers.  I also have say the music was GREAT this movie too!,\n tend forget that the master/slave context the past centuries lead more than well-tended estates, powered large groups enslaved people, and lot money for the white owners. lead group people caught the middle the offspring resulting from slave owners interferring with their female slaves.  Some these children just became more slaves, and others were free...but free and coloured, which back then meant anything but, relative the lot their sires.  A class formed around these offspring the gens couleur libre free people colour and that class was able, certain extent, own property, raise themselves from downtrodden educated, and attain comparative dignity. That say, they weren't slaves, but they were still exploited certain extent.  Often, the women lived mistresses the white plantation masters and men wealth, set their own houses, with allowances, schooling paid for for their children, and kind gentility, dependent the respectability they chose impose their families. essence, they were prostituting themselves ensure their own prosperity, and relative independence from labour arrangement called plaçage.  Feast All Saints beautifully written story about the children one such woman, the result just such arrangement with local gentleman, and the people who touched their lives, both negative and positive way. The tale was eye-opener for me, New Zealander, with real conception the black/white lines, let alone that grey area the middle where the gens couleur libre trod gingerly.  The characters are very three dimensional, and have been well-rendered this adaption the novel, Anne Rice. The parts are well-cast, the costumes are wonderful, and the brutal way the lines are drawn out, with the blurred areas made all the more distinct the conflicts the protagonists through. The gens couleur libre could not marry the whites, the slaves could not help themselves, and the whites, even the sympathetic ones, couldn't bear face the economic reality doing right the people they depended on.  I recommend this story, both the novel and the miniseries, everyone, unreservedly. you can't handle the truth you'll cringe and cower through some parts, one injustice after another meted out those colour, both their white oppressors, and their own people. Bear mind though that this nothing more than reality, and this tale absorbing way learn about it.  I know may sound callous, but this miniseries both entertained and enthralled me, despite the sour taste found mouth what went on, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Watch it. not read the period, because there's lesson learned from all.,\n This movie started out with some semblance plot, then abandoned for endless series random characters and encounters that have nothing with moving the story forward. was impossible remain engaged with this film. This movie very cynical pile garbage made some people with animation skills but totally lacking creativity storytelling ability. shockingly bad effort coming from major studio. Clearly there are morale and motivation problems Disney, not mention complete lack oversight and quality control. That management allowed this movie see the light day speaks volumes about their incompetence and desperation. This movie joins very short \"worst movies all time\" list.,\n For starters, it's very funny movie with few crazy characters running around that are bound make laugh (check out the two Russian bugs).  A Bug's Life has classical Disney storyline, but that's one the good things about the movie. Family values are praised and the main characters the film undergo some evolution order stand against the grasshoppers the end. And also has couple great voice-overs Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey (of course),... But actually, the most amazing thing about this movie the animation. It's just wonderful. All the details, great colors, every ant looks different, beautiful backgrounds... And the guys and girls Pixar made all look realistic. All all, very nice piece work. This the best animation Disney since Aladdin.,\n was very surprised see that this movie had such good rating, when checked IMDb after seeing it. This really one the worst movies have ever seen and have seen many bad movies. looks like good movie the beginning, but when comes into surgery couldn't believe how bad got. This voice-over destroys EVERYTHING! Just imagine you are being cut open like that and then listen what says. saw the movie German don't really know what said English, but ironic stuff like \"Yeah right, doesn't hurt..\"?...what this? Telling yourself \"think about something else\" and then forgetting your pain just thinking about your girlfriend just...stupid. And his mother...how the hell does she figure something like that out? Someone comes tell her, her son died surgery (what she kind had expect). Plus she found some letters Jessica Albas bag. plus that \"she knows the hospital\" stuff... and then takes her \"one second\" figure out? What the hell?^^ And the ending...why does the police bust them? The patient died surgery, thats all that happened. That drunk doctor doesn't know anything else either...and then they bust them all, even the girlfriend??? Why??? Despite all that think Christensen did bad job, but that doesn't really count for me...those mistakes and stupid things wrote about above are the problem. watched this movie with some friends and all were VERY disappointed... said, one the worst movies have ever seen... Just don't watch,\n read few reviews this movie which all said that the film dragged for too long and that was basically only sensationalistic entertainment. agree that perhaps, the film goes bit too long (2h30 would have been enough...) but certainly not think sensationalize the subject matter. Jim Jones' expansive power trip and slow degradation into mental illness, paranoia and drug abuse are never treated voyeuristic manner. The movie takes its time showing how Jones recruited followers (Brenda Vaccaro's and Brad Dourif's character are stand-outs that matter) but also observing uncanny shift Jones' perception reality. mind-boggling see egalitarian, left-wing and compassionnate preacher become such destructive and cruel dictator. Perhaps the movie doesn't explore Jones' motivations enough, which can make the whole ordeal bit superficial times (may have with censorship well...) But Powers Boothe's mesmerizing performance makes all come true. not familiar with the details the real Jim Jones' life, but Boothe sure makes the monster plays believable and real. The movie features many strong scenes, among them the preaching messes Jones, Jones's meeting with Father Divine remarquable James Earl Jones), Congressman Leo Ryan (Ned Beatty)'s visit the Guyana camp and course, the suicide scene. quite gloomy spectable watch and Boothe quite commanding those last moments. Madge Sinclair shines this scene one the suddenly sceptic follower, and Veronica Cartwright (as Jones' wife) and Brad Dourif, especially when their time comes drink the murderous potion. The relative calm the end this scene, the tasteful direction and the contrasting beauty the natural surroundings all work making those images quite impossible erase from one's mind. disturbing reflection human nature and its weaknesses. Worth watching, only keep mind one the truly horrific events the 20th century. Not let repeated again. Like, ironically, the inscription Jim Jones' camp: \"Those who not know the past are bound repeat it\".,\n This where the term \"classic film\" comes from. This wonderful story woman's bravery, courage and extreme loyalty. Poor Olan got sold her uncaring husband, who through the years learned appreciate her. (Yeah right, PEARL!!)   Luise Rainer was the beautiful star who had won the Best Actress Oscar the year before for her small role (and what waste oscar) \"The Great Zigfield\". really didn't show what, any, talent she had other than her exotic beauty. But \"Good Earth\" she shows that she can really act! Her beauty was erased and she had great costumes either. People say that she didn't show any real emotions this film. Like hell. Her character Olan shy and timid woman, with inner strength. She quiet during parts the film with only her eyes and body convey her emotions. Example: those scenes during the fall the city and when looters were being shot. you people are saying that she doesn't act well this film, you are NOT looking!  Paul Muni shows that can act well. His character not likeable one me. never sees her for what she is, until the very end the story. sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother, with her own special beauty. The greatest one all, the beauty from within, like pearl.  If you get chance see this film, watch it. You will see one the best films that the golden age Hollywood created.,\n could never stand watching Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast, knew was trouble when the best scene this movie featured Scott Baio skateboard chase scene!). Jodie Foster her first \"grown-up\" role turns her usual professional performance but that excuse for this boring mess. Two hours out life that I'll never get back! noteworthy characters, unbelievable storyline, questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst all, couldn't have cared less. The story California teens the 1970's, where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Don't waste your time watching this ugly excuse for movie.,\n live Ottawa where this film was made and really wish hadn't been. This one God-awful flick. really try and support independent films but there this stigma attached anything indie and that stigma is: Indie Films Blow. Well, this film does nothing shed this curse. The actor, writer, director Brett Kelly does little contribute the genre, rather re-hashes tired clichés from movies past. really tired menacing evil looking characters that lurk the shadows and prey the unsuspecting, it's way too overdone.   I can remember one scene particular right near the end the flick where the whole scene lit with car headlights. Now some may say that this was effect used create mood and tension, but sadly was showcase the shoestring budget this movie. well for movie that dares call itself horror, viewer will find themselves hard pressed find any actual gore, other than few scenes with corn syrup and red food colouring.   The biggest thing that drags this film down the pacing and the lack character development, the basic plot that children are being kidnapped and the parents must track down this Bonesetter fellow before certain time order get their kids back. Not that this concept bugs me, but, didn't really find believable that when the two main characters, both who have lost children can find time make out with each other. This done such short time span that it's inconceivable, first priority would get daughter back and least get know the lady before making out with her.   The last point that have is.... and won't hold this against Kelly, but the movie shot entirely boring, emotionless video and that really takes away from any tense moments that would have just oozed style film. Although this movie were given million dollar makeover and redone the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie afloat. only hope that something happens prevent Brett Kelly from making sequel, which has been reported his website, sequel that was half written one sitting.   Lord help all.,\n I've been willing put with lot from late-spring/summer action fluff movies, but general that's been due the fact that most them have reasonable payoff (i.e. cool special effects, interesting plot twists, comic value, Steve Buscemi, etc.). This movie, however, had none this. All that got was the cheap thrill several minutes Eva Longoria's cleavage (an issue Maxim cheaper than movie ticket). There embarrassing lack plot, suspense, back story, character development, continuity, etc. would get into specifics, but quite frankly I've already-maybe willingly-forgotten most the movie.  The entire time was the theater, was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching season DVD. Save your money this one, folks. Unless you really, really, really like Eva Longoria's cleavage.,\n I'm just quite disappointed with \"Soul Survivors\". doesn't worth even comment this forum. The script very poor well all the \"acting\" and for our entertainment features pointless plot.  Please, yourselves favor! real \"Survivor\"...Don't waste your time this piece crap! Someday you'll thank me!,\n What can one say about Elvira that hasn't already been said the world's press? The classic comedienne that Elvira delivers her first full-length big budget comedy masterpiece.  From the very first movie frame thingy, Elvira packs acting punch that clearly says Film Great....eat your heart out, Bette Davis! See forlorn Elvira, see excitable Elvira, see jealous Elvira, see murderous Elvira. You can nothing but marvel her acting prowess!  At the heart this comedy masterpiece Elvira's desire for Las Vegas show stardom. Despite putting \"the boob back the boobtube\" horror hostess (with the mostest), Elvira finds the small screen constrictive emotionally....and PHYSICALLY! Nuff said, she packs her kitbag and heads East....a hotdog one hand and letter from her Aunt's lawyer outlining her inheritance 'windfall' the other.  I've seen this movie many times, can almost recite verbatim....(verbatim would just showing off)!  Grab copy, laugh yourself silly, learn the lines....  Why she didn't win the Best Actress Oscar for this role beyond me.,\n This excellent film about the characters adult swimming class, their problems, relationships and interactions with each other. should have managed wider distribution it's much better than similar films from major studios out the same time.  The swimming instructor almost-Olympian, reduced teaching adults basic lessons, and often the target horndogging from his female students. attempts, more less, fend them off, with varying results.  The students characters are mainstream U.S.A; teachers, policemen, college students and retired people, all whom haven't learned swim for some reason. The movie covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests they through the class. Several subplots provide amusing fodder, including teacher going through divorce, some high school students making documentary, and girl who only the class meet guys.  This good date movie, just one watch when you're the mood for romantic drama with overtones reality.,\n The case the Scorpion's tail highly stylish giallo directed Sergio Martino, who appears giallo master second only Dario Argento.  Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this fabulous who-dunnit, quite complex but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining murder mystery. also makes sense the end, big plus, 'cause that's not always the case for these giallo's, they tend stretch credibility with their endless red-herrings and ultimate solutions. Here, the less you know about the plot, the better.  Pure giallo trademarks present here are the beautiful cinematography, the catchy music score, the gorgeous females (Anita Strindberg goddess), brutal murders, black gloved murderers and explicit sex scenes name few.  In most parts it's decently acted, Goerge Hilton his usually suave self and others fairly well. Martino directs with sure hand, keeps things tight and atmospheric with some terrific set pieces.  If you're giallo fan, this must see. you like well written and suspenseful thrillers general, this comes highly recommended.,\n This was probably the worst movie have ever seen life!! was stupid there was plot and the special affects were ridiculous!! And have never seen such bad acting life! The only good part about the movie were all the hot guys(especially Drew Fuller). don't know what these people were thinking when they made this movie!! didn't even want finish the whole thing because you get this point the movie where the guys are all bed touching themselves. mean was like some kind sick and twisted kiddy porn! would advise anyone who has heard this movie and was interested seeing just forget about and find another movie watch! was very disappointed!! The whole movie was complete waste time opinion.,\n This movie does not really promote kids nicer and have better attitudes, family movie should, and this wouldn't considered family anyway because has some things that children shouldn't seeing. Not the best ABC Family film you ask me. there were less sexual themes the movie, then maybe would better. Hollywood isn't doing anything make movie better adding sexual situations. There's really reason for them. least this movie. wouldn't want waste money this garbage renting it. you have other things other than watch this movie, please proceed them.,\n rented this horrible movie. The worst think have ever seen. believe 1st grade class could have done better job. The worse film have ever seen and have seen some bad ones. Nothing scary except paid 1.50 rent and that was 1.49 too much. The acting horrible, the characters are worse and the film just piece trash. The slauther house scenes are low budget that makes movied look like Oscar candidate. All can say you wnat waste good evening and little money rent this horrible flick. would rather watch killer clowns from outer space while sitting bucket razors than sit through this flop again,\n Where begin? How best describe just how awful this movie is???  Let's start with the campy hick humor. isn't very funny. Add bunch musicians impersonating actors Meat Loaf horrible and Deborah Harry even worse. Pity poor Art Carney, who should have known better than this movie.  And then there the plot. roadie whose life goal work Alice Cooper show meets girl whose life goal groupie for Alice Cooper. least they get what they want...  And then, just when the movie should end, they can't come with more plausible last scene than well, won't ruin for you you really want see the movie.  There are certain actors that let you know that this going \"B\" movie perhaps worse. Gailard Sartain one them for and has more prominent role. That's sure sign that the movie probably won't very good. nothing else, the movie lives the low expectations even exceeds them being worse than poor.  Let's just say this. This the movie against which all bad movies are compared. And none are worse than Roadie.,\n The movie starts something like less hyper-kinetic, more pastiche Dead Alive: strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered police officers. But when police officer killed, one Tatsuhito gets involved... and when discovers that his brother Shihito also involved, things get bloody quite fast.  An earlier work Miike's, Shinjuku Triad Society still filled with his usual the ol' ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts, though it's not one his more eclectic flamboyant pieces. Rather, it's pretty well crafted bit pulp fiction, Tatsuhito digs his way through the underground, maze that leads him gay Triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from Taiwan and keeps almost-brothel young boys (one particular the character who kills the cop the beginning). Tatsuhito's brother getting involved with said society, Tatsuhito himself forced become dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics penetrate into this sordid realm.  What's mainly interesting about this little bit work the relationship Tatsuhito has with his nemesis, Wang. Tatsuhito Japanese born China, later moved back into Japan, and alienated for it. Wang Chinese who felt alienated China, killed his father and developed crime wing Japan. Wang also surprisingly Shakespearian character, which weird enough is, much less that you actually begin feel sorry for him the time his ultimate showdown with Tatsuhito comes be. And Tatsuhito himself similarly tragic figure when he's forced contend with his lack ability control his brother. While would rude state that Miike's movies are successful mostly their shock value, true that sometimes it's easy lose track how well Miike can create bitter, dis-impassioned characters.  --PolarisDiB,\n This tale based two Edgar Allen Poe pieces (\"The Fall the House Usher\", \"Dance Death\" (poem) actually quite creepy from beginning end. similar some the old black-and-white movies about people that meet old decrepit house (for example, \"The Cat and the Canary\", \"The Old Dark House\", \"Night Terror\" and on). Boris Karloff plays demented inventor life-size dolls that terrorize the guests. dies early the film (or does and the residents the house are subjected number terrifying experiences. won't into too much detail here, but definitely must-see for fans old dark house mysteries.  Watch with plenty popcorn and soda darkened room.  Dan Basinger 8/10,\n It's been long time since last saw movie this bad.. The acting very average, the story horribly boring, and I'm loss for words the execution. was completely unoriginal. and this much comedy Clint Eastwood's pregnant Schwarzenegger!   One the first scenes (the one with the television show where the hell are you?) got right the cast was 80% let's face forgotten actors. they were hoping for career relaunch, then think might never happen with this their CV! The script had the potential, but neither 80% the actors nor the director (who's actor and clearly should stick being actor) pulled off. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any the rest.  I'm sorry, but you ever consider watching this highly recommend you turn something less traumatic, because not only it's total loss time, but also weak example what bad cinema looks like.,\n Dreamquest far, the best porn movie I've ever viewed. This must see!!! And you're skeptical about your little ones watching it, just skip over the naughty scenes. course, this shortens the movie length about minutes. But even then it's enjoyable. This movie quite excellent and beats out almost any movie...even Shawshank Redemption.,\n Derek might have had career had she not let her late husband, John, take over her director. It's real shame, really, with the right direction and the right part (see \"10\"), was okay. She wouldn't win any awards even her best, but she worse than many actress who has made big the past years based looks alone. But therein lay the problem, John was determined ride the wave that created with her appearance 10, that being the \"perfect 10,\" \"the hottest woman America,\" \"the sex symbol the 1980s.\" Problem is, John's hands, this wave crashed with resounding thud only few year's time. Maybe knew her limitations actress, perhaps that why fashioned movies for her that concentrated her body, not her acting skills. But got old real quick. didn't help matters any that the films John and Derek are (let's honest) really, really bad. And bad sums their take Edgar Rice Burrough's literary icon, the Lord the Jungle, Tarzan the Apes.  You know what's worst? This film boring! Make laugh, make cry, just don't bore me. Not even Bo's stunning looks and figure can rouse any interest, and that what the film course built around. Richard Harris (God bless his soul, and were previously Orca btw) hams and makes his scenes least little interesting and Miles O'Keefe makes physically impressive Tarzan. Maybe got the last laugh, after being hit with ton venom from the critics over this film, Miles went solid career movie icon, films that were not great art, but million times more fun than this one. But other than that, it's Bo's body,and you can only see many times before you long for something else with it. Tarzan the Ape Man has nothing else. John Derek was truly dynamic actor, was not director. should have stayed with his strength. This film unfolds mind numbingly slow pace and nothing really happens the action scenes. Burrough's Tarzan was all about excitement and wish fulfillment (who wouldn't want agile, strong and good looking Lord Greystoke?) and fun! You get none that here. Watch it, and you will have wasted 107 minutes your life. second thought, you may come away with valuable lesson, how not handle someone's movie career.   Bo Derek all right book though. She stood John until his dying day, has true love animals and nature and even looks back with giggle her time the spotlight. She has also proven that she not the dumb blonde many want her make her out be. she could survive Tarzan and Bolero, she can survive anything. come back Bo, all forgiven.  And aside, the Steve Strong who plays the bad guy the same Steve Strong who brief pro wrestling career?,\n Based the idea from Gackt, Moon Child took place poverty-stricken country called Mallepa. futuristic timeline, the story followed the lives the two main characters, Kei (HYDE) and Sho (Gackt) and their friends growing together.  Despite some actions might overly done perhaps humorous, strongly believed that this movie about friendship. Even amongst all the hardships between each character, the end, each them wanted have someone their side, have friends.  Unlike most vampire characters, Kei portrayed vampire that loathed the idea having kill order live. vampire found friendship the hand young boy, Sho who's not afraid Kei. Regardless what some might've thought, see Kei fatherly figure Sho. Kei was there throughout the earlier life Sho, took care him, and taught him live world where power between gangs controls their lives. the other hand, Sho who perhaps can seen innocent enthusiastic style young man, grew man who realised that life isn't all about fun and games, that death exists and able take away his loved ones.  I love the part where Lee Hom, the actor who played Son, first appeared the screen. The way they met was quite cool indeed. Son also has big part within this movie, the fact that he's from different race, Taiwanese, made quite impact the friendship theme within the movie. The way how friendships were developed despite background differences was portrayed excellently this movie.  I believed that each actor did great job considering that this was their first time appear such big screen movie. Both HYDE and Gackt managed act quite well and created quite believable characters. Unlike movies that had musician turned actors and filled the movie with songs, they've done great acting jobs! Moon Child really made impact for me, has given friendships new meaning and consideration, that have appreciate every friendship our lifetimes. The movie shows lot hope, despite all the bad things that happen their lives, that there's always hope. Life can cruel, that seems hope doesn't exist anymore. also shows very strong sense friendships between each other, even when Son became the enemy, Sho did have some sort \"fun\" their last battle. Every single one them desired peace the end, matter how far apart they've become. The ending scene showed us.,\n commented this when first debuted and gave \"thumbs the middle\" review, remarking that I'd give the benefit the doubt beyond just the first episode. I've seen total six episodes now this point June 2006. And lifelong Batman fanatic, can say without hesitation: this show utter crap.  Everything's wrong with it. Everything. Getting past just the lousy animation and design, the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with character development apparent interest the writers this dreck give any substance any stories.  And for God's sake...is just me, the Joker EVERY EPISODE?? Gotham that much revolving-door justice system? Or, again, just complete lack interest the writers put any effort into other villains (see \"no character development\", above).  And make matters worse, every single Joker tale the same 3-part formula.  1) Joker gasses people.  2) Joker sets out gas the whole city.  3) Batman saves the day.  Pfeh.  There was one episode saw that wasn't Joker story. The title escapes me, but the villain was that nefarious Cluemaster...the \"Think Thank Thunk\" episode with the quiz show. That was the single-worst Batman story I've ever seen, heard read. Yes, worse than \"I've Got Batman Basement.\"   I can't really say what feel this show because it's probably against the ToS, but starts with \"B\" and rhymes with \"fastardization\". Thank goodness for the existence the Timm/Dini/etc. era Bat-entertainment, back from the Fox and Kids days. Stuff that good, and should have known this, just couldn't possibly have lasted forever, unfortunately.,\n So, Todd Sheets once stated that considers his 1993, shot-on-video Z-epic, Zombie Bloodbath his first feature film. Anyone who's ever seen little beauty called Zombie Rampage knows exactly how untrue that statement is. mean, what makes this one that much more superior? Well, then again, Zombie Rampage doesn't include that mullet guy, now does it?   For one comprehend exactly why Zombie Bloodbath actually considered worth damn, one must remember what the 90's were like for lovers bad horror. decade that all but said goodbye and Z-cinema knew it. Technological advances, awkward trends, and the internet would abolish the mysterious charms the s.o.v.'s big-boxed golden years. And anything remotely resembling quality schlock was all too self-aware for it's own good, basically defeating the purpose. Luckily, not everyone changes with the times. Enter Zombie Bloodbath.  And guess this the part where explain the same exact premise from 500 other zombie flicks from the last years. Alright, so, Some kind accident nuclear plant infects everyone sight, turning them into flesh-eating zombies, who rampage, inflicting some the most gruesome, yet humorous gore-scenes the 90's. The first minutes are cluttered with the most awkward-sounding conversations you could imagine. Conversations that let you know that this isn't just low-budget zombie flick, this Z-grade disasterpiece, fella. plenty Hysterical, non-existent acting around, and that goes triple for Mr. Mullet. That guy truly the highlight the night.  The fact that Todd Sheets seriously considers Zombie Bloodbath THAT superior Zombie Rampage, amuses end. mean really, both are complete jokes celluloid, but then again, Redneck Zombies, so, obviously Todd Sheets the company awsomeness. 1993, movie this bad would doubt, full-blast spoof, but Mr. Sheets stands his ground, giving some good old fashion schlock, the way was meant be, unaware, clueless, and pointless. God bless Todd Sheets. For anyone seeking surprisingly worthwhile 90's B-Horror, Leif Jonker's Darkness should the top your list. for Zombie Bloodbath, you're gorehound who got bored sometime around 1990, then '93 would the perfect time pick up. 8/10,\n recently bought this movie with bunch other LaserDiscs from eBay. Usually, into war and action movies but occasionally enjoy romantic comedies.  If you are bored today's special films and high gloss romantic comedies you should check out Shop Around the Corner quiet evening. What like about the movie that the characters have lot decency. There nothing fake pretentious about them. Take Mr. Matuschek for example: When finds out that his wife cheating him with one his own employees tries shot himself. Not just because the humiliation but because has been unjust the character Stewart. (OK, weired example.)   Yes, the focus the movie narrow and the plot predictable. Yet still, liked lot. you likes Notting Hill then you will like Shop around the corner. fact, Hugh Grant reminds lot Jimmy Stewart.,\n Lubitsch's last production but not his least interesting film. Somehow largely ignored critics couldn't finish himself and the movie wasn't co-signed Preminger who did most the staging... very strange mix musical remembrance The Merry Widow ?)and classic Lubitsch touch sentimentalism (an impossible love-story like Cluny Brown)yet very clever and intelligent one yet not understood some nostalgia some lost world but rather testament eternal feelings prevailing the foolishness mankind and especially men times war with \"moral\" lesson still true today was 1948. Billy wilder answer Preminger who grieved Lubitsch's funerals about having lost great man replied that still had his films and that sums all about that Lady Ermine...,\n had mixed feelings for \"Les Valseuses\" (1974) written and directed Bertrand Blier when started watching but ended liking it. would not call vulgar (\"Dumb and Dumber\" vulgar, \"The Sweetest Thing\" both vulgar and unforgivably stupid); would call shocking and offensive. can understand why many viewers, especially, the females would not like even hate it. the epitome misogyny (or seems), and the way two antiheroes treat every woman they'd meet seems unspeakable. But the more think the more realize that somehow comes off delightful little gem. fascinated how Blier was able get away with it. The movie very entertaining and highly enjoyable: well written, the acting all first class, and the music sweet and melancholic. Actually, when think it, two buddies had done something good the women they came across to: they prepared woman the train (the lovely, docile blonde Brigitte Fossey who started her movie career with one the most impressive debuts René Clément's \"Forbidden Games\"(1952) age for the meeting with her husband whom she had not seen for two months; they found man who was finally able get frigid Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) exited and satisfied; they enlightened and educated young and very willing Isabelle Huppert (in one her early screen appearances.) Their encounter with Jeanne Moreau elevates this comedy the tragic level. short, not sure I'd like meet Gérard Depardieu's Jean-Claude and Patrick Dewaere's Pierrot real life and invite them over for dinner but had good time watching the movie and two hours almost flew was never boring.,\n Hazzard County, Georgia, cousins and Luke Duke (Scott, Knoxville) and their cousin Daisy Duke (Jessica Simpson) run moonshine made their Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson) while avoiding the local authority, Boss Hog (Burt Reynolds). Their problems with the Boss are only beginning they learn he's been plotting strip mine the town for valuable ores found below it.  I have never seen the show and after watching the movie, I'm not going start any time soon. like stupid comedies but this one didn't offer many laughs. was pretty dull picture with the first hour being really hard sit through. The second part was little better but this film was still missed opportunity. The film focused and Luke way too much. The characters general weren't very interesting and the actors portraying them didn't very good job.  The acting wasn't very good. wasn't expecting good the first place but none the leads were very funny. Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville both give below average performances. The latter was pretty good Stifler but tries way too hard here. The latter just seems looking for paycheck and nothing else. Jessica Simpson isn't known for her acting nor she really known for her singing. She's famous for having her own reality show and for saying really dumb things. She pretty but she's weak actor. doesn't matter though because she doesn't really appear the movie and the character she plays isn't complex anything. Willie Nelson also has minor role and doesn't anything special.  The screenplay was written John O'Brien and made two films prior the Dukes Hazzard. The first one was Cradle the Grave, which was okay. The second one was Starsky and Hutch which was pretty funny. doesn't good job here though the story mess. also forgot add jokes and few other things that would have made this film work better. The movie also pretty long for comedy. Okay, 106 minutes isn't exactly long but feels much longer because there's very little humor the first hour. think comedies should kept short else they have find lot material cover the entire running time. The Dukes Hazzard barely has enough funny gags keep going for thirty minutes let alone 106 minutes. The car sequences were average and they don't save already troubled film. the end, Dukes Hazzard may appeal few people but most people will probably find dull and it's better you just skip it. Rating 4/10,\n was honestly surprised Alone the Dark. was bad, could hardly believe what was seeing. There are characters, just few stereotypes wandering around and getting killed. The extent the character development was giving each character name and occupation, and that's about it. There was real plot, and none the characters seemed have any motivation. fact, many action scenes just began their own, coming from nowhere with pounding techno track. While was watching this movie kept asking \"Where this happening? What's going on?\" The acting was high school drama quality, with stiff wooden delivery, though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines. Their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious horrible sound design. ADR sounded like was recorded open room. The actors were constantly taking obvious care hit their marks, looking almost robotic their movements. So, these listless automatons are whisked through series implausible and confusing scenarios, often without even the benefit transition scenes. They were here, now they're there. This was happening, now that's happening. Random scenes with little rhyme reason. had lot fun watching it. Definitely not worth nine bucks though.,\n would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for Jason (Herb) Evers constant harping experiment. Many early reviewers The Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifune overacting. Yet, more and more critics viewed that film they saw being purposefully done. Jason Evers obviously not Toshiro Mifune, and his overacting exactly that.  Most the actors this classic were rather good actors, minus Evers and the showgirls. you watch this movie, you would have noticed Evers shouting almost every line, that until smoking and blowing the smoke coolly out his nose.   The special effects were par for the course movie such this one. hindsight, there isn't much that stands out mind fantastically good bad for this movie.,\n don't know what some you are smoking, but suspect it's potent.  To call Swept Away awful would insult the very concept terribleness. The acting hideous and i'm not picking Madonna here, all know she's useless, but someone should have warned everyone else that her ailment contagious. back literally hurts from cringing much poorly delivered lines. The editing sloppy, beggars description. The photography and composition (which this era, competence should GIVEN for any film with budget) are astonishingly inept, even the lighting horrid and unnatural looking. These are BASIC elements filmmaking, you can't get them right, you should seek another line work. It's contrived grade production Snow White, except nowhere near well made interesting.  The original film Lina Wertmueller wonderful satire and metaphor, superbly acted and written, featuring breathtaking visuals you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the windswept sand your hair. The sexual tension feels real and immediate...those you who found Guy Ritchie's version deplorable, should see it, really one the landmarks world cinema.  Those you who thought the remake some kind masterpiece should have your heads examined.,\n Thanks Kevin Smith, bunch geeks are running around saying that Return the Jedi isn't any good because it's actually fun watch. And no! Muppets are involved! That makes bad! Everyone liked Return the Jedi until someone Kevin Smith movie made negative comment about it. Now all sudden people people look you like you have some kind disease you mention how much you like it. This movie much better than anything Kevin Smith ever even considered creating that boggles mind that the man would even think denouncing it. This movie good fun! It's just awesome remember being when was six! Enjoy this movie for what and stop stealing Kevin Smith's opinions! His aren't correct!  And that Ewok song the end ruled! bet you people don't even enjoy \"Ewoks: Battle for Endor\"!!!! I'm going set you all fire!,\n I'm Belgian and grew the sixties. Most the series were shown over here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one the first was keen on. Unfortunately over here caused \"panic hysteria\" amongst the mothers because Batman was considered too violent. Geez, compare the innocence that series the crap kids get see nowadays. because the over-protective mothers from the 60s only got chance see maybe two three episodes got frustrated started collect the comics and bubblegum cards (still got them compensate. even got the View Master slides... had urge see the caped crusader. All kids need some kind hero.  Years later finally got the chance see the re-runs adolescent and enjoyed tremendously. The tongue-in-cheek acting would have escaped when would've watched kid, but understood the age 17. Yeah, I've watched them all now and the occasional kind soul the internet posts episodes because they haven't released the series DVD (to knowledge)  This evening enjoyed \"Return the bat cave\"... was delight watch because was full trivia and inside-jokes. see Adam and Burt was delight and this movie simply fantastic every aspect. They play themselves they played their parts the series.  Congratulations the people who produced this great nostalgic \"feast\"... I'm gonna watch again. advice all Batman fans is: SEE !!! Rent !!! Lend from friend !!! Buy !!! I'd never expect myself rate this 9/10... Very well done,\n I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided film James Cain's novel \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" (I'm not even sure Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie definitely interesting. not the best version Cain's story like the 1981 version best), but thanks Visconti's excellent direction and the casting Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti very sensual couple), must for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities great effect. The film not perfect, though. main complaint that the film little too long for its own good; the story moves very slow pace don't think Visconti was very good editing his films). think film noir works better with short running time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested. Anyhow, much like this film and the remakes, think one has made the definitive version Cain's much-praised book.,\n and hated this film its the worst film earth totally wasted time watching and was disappointed with cause the cover and the back the film looks pretty good, but was wrong its bad. but when saw delta she was totally different and bad actress and really didn't know how old the girls was trying was confused. the film was some parts confusing and didn't enjoy all but watched all the film just see was going get better but didn't, was boring,dull and did say BORING.and don't think many other people liked well me.boring boring boring,\n The boys are working outside recording studio when they hear \"the voice angel.\" That would Miss Van Doren, auditioning and going under the name Miss Andrews because her father doesn't approve her being \"radio singer\". However, she hopes certain big-wig, Mrs. Bixby, friend her dad's will hire her, and then will have give his approval.  She leaves but within minutes the boys are running amok the studio causing havoc and having other musicians out kill them after they ruin the recording session. Finally things calm down. \"Whew, eluded them,\" says Moe. \"Yeah, got away, too,\" answers Curly.  The boys then fool around the studio, put Miss Van Doren's record and Curly gets dressed women's clothes and pretends he's singing. Mrs. Bixby walks in, impressed and hires \"Seniorita Cucacha\" the spot! For extra $500, she's asked come and sing their high-society party that night. The rest, they say,is history Curly pretends opera singer with some funny results. Oh, the way, accompanied \"Senior Mucho\" and \"Senior Gusto.\"  What happens the party simply that the truth wins out, but not before few slapstick antics take place. all, pretty good episode. enjoyed but wouldn't rate anything special.,\n Don't swayed the naysayers. This wonderfully spooky film. This was thesis project for the writer/director Petty. did great job having the edge seat. never really knew what expect, and for jaded horror-movie goer, this Nirvana! The film concerns elderly man who lives isolated log cabin the woods. One day, while searching for his cat the woods, witnesses the murder child, does he? agonizes about this the rest the film. What most unusual about this film that here dialogue until the last few scenes. found this intriguing. The writer manages get hold your senses and gives them relentless tug. Give this film go, you won't disappointed.,\n The show had great episodes, this not one them. It's not terrible episode, it's just hard follow \"The man that was death.\", \"All through the house\", and \"Dig that cat, he's real gone.\"  This episode about couple that has just been married Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). the first five minutes you find out that Charles only married Peggy for her money. The two their honeymoon and their car breaks down dirt road and they have seek refuge old abandon mansion. Charles soon finds out secret Peggy's family...  In opinion you should watch this episode, but just don't expect the same feeling the rest the episodes the first season.,\n have nothing against religious movies. Religious people need something watch Saturday night, guess. But what really ticks off when the write-up the DVD box does not indicate this fact the potential viewer. Passing off religious propaganda entertainment NOT cool, bro.  And even was religious person, would have agree with most the other posters here, this movie was mess. Poorly directed, poorly acted, poorly edited, and the attempt soundtrack was hilarious. The fake accents were terrible, the characters were mainly stereotypes, and continuity was out the window. The only reason sat through this lame waste time was that was too late watch another movie instead. Should have just gone bed.  Absolutely redeeming qualities this movie, unless you are the religious type who will immediately endorse anything that will preach your beliefs the unbelievers, even it's pile garbage. you aren't, avoid this all costs. not deceived the box write-up.,\n Shallow, shallow script ...stilted acting ...the shadows boom mikes lingering over the actors' heads scenes ...worth watching because Kate Mulgrew plays the most selfish mother movie history and it's all before Ben Affleck got his teeth capped.,\n Thanks Warner Archive, can once again see this mammoth variety show which throws everything but the kitchen sink. (The bathtub, however present.) This film gives screen time every person who was under contract Warners the time. some the artists seem unfamiliar some, because they were big the silent days, and most faded with the popularity the talkies. There are some truly remarkable artists from the vaudeville era well. You will most impressed with Winnie Lightner, who performs two numbers. Also there that French star, Irene Bordoni who croons love song sexy manner. Perhaps one the biggest highlights the two-strip Technicolor \"Chinese Fantasy,\" which has been restored for this version. truly beautiful and stars Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there the massive \"Lady Luck\" finale which goes for nearly quarter hour. This truly epic the early-talkie era. Any old-movie buff will love this.,\n The IMDb plot summary way describes the essence this film. should have read 'Be prepared catapulted back the prison the 3rd pew from the back your family's church years old, listening the preacher drone about God's will while all you can think getting back home your Lego'.  It starts off well intentioned, building intrigue planting some real and surreal clues such Renny's 'how did the cut thumb heal fast?' moment. then slowly morphs into Christian jamboree, sacrificing its plot completely wash evangelistic-induced babble. believe counted the use the word 'pray' about times five minute span near the end. After the 31st, tried twist the context the word its synonym, 'prey'. Sadly, this little mind game mine made the film least bearable for the last minutes. Plus made laugh whenever character would say 'prayer' ('preyer' me) became totally zany. Indeed, even Catholic wife sunk her chair from boredom, almost the point ending the floor.  For all the salivating Christians who ranked this film 8-10 stars, suggest sticking with your theology-reinforcing safety standards like Circle Square, The Ten Commandments, anything from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and the like. Stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter films such Jesus Camp, The God Who Wasn't There, What Would Jesus Buy, the soon-to-be released Religulous.  Maybe Robert Whitlow's book better.,\n This one all time favorite movies and would recommend anyone. list favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones par with are movies such The Lord the Rings series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home.  I can really relate the main character Jess. the start the movie she's shy girl with slightly odd background who has lot more friends who are boys than that are girls. She really sucks you into her life. also certainly can't fault any the protagonist's acting, anyone else's the film.  The soccer was interesting watch even for someone like who has idea the rules. The movie never boring. The romance really cute and didn't make blush tooooo hard! One thing that really made though was the Indian factor. Jess' parents are Indian and there are many colourful Indian conventions throughout the film providing very interesting cultural insight well everything else. The Indian people are also hilarious! Essentially this coming age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it.  Feel good comedies are becoming favorite movie genre thanks this film. They're funny, they're refreshing and they make you feel good! ^_~,\n read about this movie magazine and was intrigued. woman, who one day sees herself drive past her own car. Well, thought, this could interesting...  ...but isn't. First, the title. The Broken? The Broken...what? What broken? The...oh, wait...I get it, the title itself \"broken\"! WOW, clever! Unfortunately, this virtually the only thing going for it.  The premise not that bad, but think Kiefer Suderland did much better 'Mirrors'. cross between Invasion the Body Snatchers and Mirrors, and rather mediocre one that. more suited title would 'The Boring', since draws out every single scene for bloody ages. maybe 'The Confusing' since doesn't explain anything all, not the narrative nor the story itself, only some vague idea about evil copies and somesuch, dotted with cheap scares and scenes used death, but nothing tangible. It's just messed up.  On the other hand, the acting and the special effects are quite good, but then again, it's not difficult role act.  After watching the movie twice, still feel unsatisfied, little confused maybe, and not the Poe Stephen King kind way. yourself favor, and don't watch this one. Simply put, there are better thrillers out there.,\n ....Rather well done, actually--attack the evil villains their lair, stop Little Big Horn style ambush, save the day via the waterboys' bugling, works for me. Stiff Upper British lip and all that.  So how does play DVD years later? Struck being like Western, subbing Apaches Sioux for the Thugs, and the Cavalry for the Imperial British Army. It's very Colonial it's outlook, you know? White Man's burden and all that? Kipling certainly would have approved.  Cary Grant, Fairbanks and MacLaglen play broadly possible, putting some buddy buddy slapstick into the mix between the shootings and brawlings for good measure. had idea was Joan Fontaine the token army wife--did they leave some her scenes the cutting room floor? very short-) None them were aiming for Oscar here--in fact Grant was not his best few scenes--but sod it, still works. And where else would Ben Casey wind Indian bugler? Only Hollywood.  Def. check this out you like adventure and pseudo-Western style antics. was done bunch pros, well might add.  *** outta ****,\n The cast really helps make this pleasant surprise and cut above the normal man-vs.-woman-argue-all-the-time-but-wind up-in love-type Hollywood screwball romance/comedy.  I usually don't for those type films and that tiresome storyline but this one was refreshing, fun watch, and oozes with charm.  Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play off each other well and make very handsome couple. The supporting cast outstanding from the always-likable Felix Bressart the villain Joseph Schildkraut.   Frank Morgan also plays one the most interesting characters I've ever seen him his career. takes the film and turns around into whole different mood for awhile when something dramatic happens him. That \"twist\" another reason this film rises above others its kind.  Once again, when film has good mix categories, usually succeeds. This great example that. this movie, it's romance, comedy and drama and it's well done. I'll take this over the re-make \"You've Got Mail,\" any day. comparison.,\n Too Much Something Borrowed Grade B-  Super Bowl Sunday one the slowest days movie theaters every year. Because this, movie studios tend avoid releasing bigger budgeted films that weekend. Every few years studio releases counter-programming female skewing movie (2001's \"The Wedding Planner\") compete with the big game. This Super Bowl weekend similarly titled \"The Wedding Date\" will try find success and attract viewers not watching the game.   Sick people feeling sorry for her, single-woman, Kat Ellis (Debra Messing, TV's \"Will and Grace\") hires male escort Nick Dermot Mulrony, \"About Schmidt\") pose her boyfriend for her sister's wedding London. Her family has been giving her hard time about her not being married, and her ex- fiancé seven years, who dumped her without reason, the best man. make him jealous Kat parades Nick around her make him see what missing. But ultimately Nick helps Kat realize that she can open up, and let someone love her.  The film borrows too much from similar wedding movies. almost carbon copy 1999's \"Picture Perfect\" and mixes scenes similar \"The Wedding Planner\" and \"My Best Friends Wedding\". The movie also has reverse \"Pretty Women\" theme going for it, and knowing her audience, the director makes clever references that and other films.  \"The Wedding Date\" has all the clichéd elements typical wedding movie, there the stereotypical overbearing mother (Holland Taylor, \"Legally Blonde\"), and practically plagiarized wedding speeches the family and friends the wedding and rehearsal dinner. The twist the ending has been done before, but was something that wasn't completely expected. The real reason why Kat was dumped comes surprise and changes the direction the film for the last half hour.  Even though \"The Wedding Date\" predictable, able stand its own. Debra Messing, her first lead role, proves she can charming and funny. Dermot Mulrony has great chemistry with Debra Messing, but most his dialogue was too corny and unrealistic. able make best what given, and able salvage the character.   By the use many clever puns (often sexual), the film actually funny. Although primarily chick-flick the film has components everyone can enjoy. The feel good story, and humor make the best date movie released long time.,\n This the movie that epitomizes the D&D fear the 80s (and even today). The fear being that people who play D&D (or any other role-playing game for that matter) will \"sucked in\" and lose their ability distinguish reality from fantasy (and killing sprees, child sacrifices, suicide, etc). Great movie for anyone who likes blame the problems society inanimate objects, but anyone who has played role-playing game, video game, even acted play will see this insult their intelligence. D&D what Wargames was computers. Plus movie, just kinda sucks.,\n This movie wonderful. always has been always will be. I'm mean really what better then house maid falling love. Walt really out did him self here. And the music! dream wish your heart makes beautiful! What else can you say besides terrific! can't wait until the special edition comes out will awesome! can't wait hear all the deleted songs! This movie done beautiful and smart! lovely. What about the cute mice too! know keep saying the same things over and over and over again but hey this great movie! Woods was terrific this beautiful beautiful BEAUTIFUL movie,\n Like many Americans, was first introduced the works Hayao Miyazaki when saw \"Spirited Away.\" fell love with the film and have seen many times. Now search see every film Miyazaki. One his earlier works \"Castle the Sky.\" Although it's still enjoyable, it's not good \"Spirited Away\" (though comparing this any film his 2002 masterpiece perhaps unfair).  A young boy named Pazu (James Van Der Beek) working mine late one night, when sees girl fall slowly from the sky. When she wakes the next morning, she introduces herself Sheeta (Anna Paquin). But Sheeta has secret, and before knows it, Pazu pulled into adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates, the army and lost floating city.  Going into film Hayao Miyazaki means you can expect one thing: sense wonder and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but one can create sense magic and awe like Miyazaki. Watching film Miyazaki like experiencing fantastic dream from your childhood.  Because the film animated, dubbing the film does not pose much problem because next impossible determine whether not the lip movements match the words. also helps that the translated dialogue well-written and voiced talented actors. The voice acting varied. James Van Der Beek fares best. brings irresistible enthusiasm and excitement the role Pazu that perfect for the character. Anna Paquin nearly good Sheeta. She's frightened the events going around her, but she knows what she has do. Mark Hamill unrecognizable the evil Muska. He's dangerous and wants something from Sheeta, and will anything get it. The other voices are bad. Cloris Leachman awful Dola. Leachman may have won Oscar for \"The Last Picture Show,\" but she's annoying the pirate leader. Leachman gives the character obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous. It's bad nearly ruins the film! Jim Cummings effective voice-over actor, but he's miscast the general.  I would definitely recommend seeing \"Castle the Sky.\" I'll probably end buying myself. But even though it's not good \"Spirited Away,\" it's still pretty good.,\n not one those people that will walk out movie that was based source material and automatically say, \"The book was better.\" know better than demote the value movie just because wasn't faithful adaptation. There lengthy process and lots decisions that into making movie that are sometimes out the director's/editor's/cinematographer's/producer's control and certainly out the original author's control. Therefore, unreasonable expect movie exactly the same, word for word, book play video game Disneyland Ride, whatever! movie should judged its own standard and how fits society. Moreover, successful movie should made because the material relevant the society which belongs and, based source material, its relevance needs reexamined and enhanced the filmmakers.   Films like There Will Blood follow this paradigm because while was based novel written the turn the century, Oil!, feels relevant because things like the Iraq war and energy concerns that the film's country origin, the US, was and experiencing. Even King Kong, based the original film, benefits from using new technology and concerns animal rights that people have.  With that said, just don't understand why they even bothered make this movie? Besides the great performances, guaranteed Oscar nods and Shanley's director/writers fee and royalties will get, this movie seems come from nowhere. should have simply stayed play. The movie (which essentially the same the play) says nothing new about the reprehensible sexual atrocities committed and many cases covered the Catholic church here and abroad. says nothing new different than the original play. can't help but compare this movie another movie that came out around the same time: Frost/Nixon, which was also based play. Frost/Nixon, while about Nixon's regrets, seems relevant because seems have come time when President Bush was about leave office. The regrets that Nixon had, depicted the play/movie, about the war and his presidency could just easily reflected Bush and his presidency. that respect Frost/Nixon seemed more relevant and actually benefited from wider distribution via film because got people talking and reflecting about the political status quo the country the time. contrast, Doubt felt like was yesterday's news and didn't seem offer anything that the play didn't offer.  Of course the movie \"good,\" the performances are outstanding, and the screenplay adaptation apt, but what? Why didn't just stay play? Why, besides marketing and financial reasons, make into movie? gave audiences nothing new discus about the awful subject.,\n This was the worst movie saw WorldFest and also received the least amount applause afterwards! can only think receiving such recognition based the amount known actors the film. It's great see J.Beals but she's only the movie for few minutes. M.Parker much better actress than the part allowed for. The rest the acting hard judge because the movie ridiculous and predictable. The main character totally unsympathetic and therefore bore watch. There real emotional depth the story. movie revolving about actor who can't get work doesn't feel very original me. Nor does the development the cop. feels like one many straight-to-video movies saw back the 90s ... And not even good one those standards. <br,\n FATTY DRIVES THE BUS simply the funniest, most original and entertaining piece work have ever had the pleasure seeing.  this movie means Hollywood standards, even that straight-to-video movie fluff comedy starring terry \"hulk\" hogan, terms camera work, editing, acting, budget, anything else.  what this movie DOES have though, very original and enjoyable story, and obviously done people who love making it, and the enthusiasm the all the cast and crew really break through all its budget and acting downfalls.  this movie proves that you don't need huge budget decent actors make great film, all you need are some original ideas and some passion for what your doing.  simply the best movie ever. don't care how you get it, rent it, order it, steal it, download it, just see this movie.  now just hope they make DVD version.,\n   Once ignored some the implausibilities, this was actually fairly decent horror/monster flick. So, I'll give some the good points first: the dragon was quite convincing, especially she prowled through the tunnels looking for lunch (hint: she likes humans). the action was fairly non stop, and, after weak beginning, got quite absorbed the storyline. sorry say, was kind rooting for the dragon she was probably the most convincing and consistent character the movie.  Now for the implausible stuff **maybe some spoilers**: you were hunting fire-breathing dragon 1100 AD, would you charge into its cave with barrel gunpowder under your arm? Duh. female character with all-American name, blonde hair and obvious Slavic accent, trying pretend she's Spanish? Huh? lead scientist whose Slavic accent you can cut with knife, and he's supposedly born Chicago, educated USA? military helicopter pilot who does his own repairs, flies huge transport copter with other crew, and expert marksman and combat soldier boot? OK. huh. won't even mention his giving different call signs minutes while communicating with his base.  It's still better than some the Japanese monster flicks from the 60's, but not much. we're lucky, won't see Dragon Fighter though naturally the ending left that possibility wide open. Or, maybe, they'll hire real director next time.  In spite everything, gave this flick out 10. Add more they rewrite the plot, and Dean Cain gets eaten the first ten minutes. <grin>,\n After the success the second instalment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should have third appearance. This time instead Tudor times Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson) living the time the French Revolution. Accompanied the now stupid but lovable Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder the \"faithful\" butler George, the Prince Regent Wales (Hugh Laurie). Throughout this third series the wonderfully written sitcom Blackadder tries everything can get rich and powerful. tries electing lord for rotten borough, tries sell book, tries win bet about The Scarlet Pimpernel, tries highway man and finally poses the Prince. This very good instalment the popular comedy. Includes appearances from Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. won the BAFTA for Best Comedy Series, and was nominated for Best Design and Best Make Up. Rowan Atkinson was number The Greatest British Actors, was number The Comedians' Comedian, and was number Britain's Favourite Comedian, Edmund Blackadder was number The 100 Greatest Characters, and was number The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, and Blackadder (all four series) was number Britain's Best Sitcom. Outstanding!,\n The story about the life common people from Antwerp, living their lives. said it, and there nothing more actually tell about the story. The movie fast, like MTV-flick, and well photographed and feel that the director talented and should more films. let's forget about this one and hope for the best with the next Deus-Barman picture.,\n Man the ending this film terribly unwatchable and dated that entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy. Now most the rest the film was okay. had few unintentionally funny scenes but had few real good camera shots and editing. Yes Alderich great director who made FLight The Phoenix and Whatever Happened Baby Jane among others. The problem isn't with direction, acting anything technical. The movie just destroyed the third act. Why? The murders, twists, turns and characters have all been revolving around NUCLEAR MATERIAL? What the heck was the writer smoking when came with that? The way just comes out nowhere may have been the biggest Deus Machina history. For all the complaints about Burton's Planet the Apes, THe life David Gale Notorious think THIS the worst ending ever. What let down.,\n Pay attention the comments behind the curtain! The majority people leaving positive comments about this film must receiving royalties. This horrible film every way. Imagine high school kids with money and sense humor making slasher/comedy video. They would receive for this. College kids would receive asked leave the school. Since this monstrosity was made \"Professionals\" believe there should jail time least cinema probation. enjoy watching bad movies Like \"Plan From Outer Space\" but, this thing doesn't even fall into that category. The script, acting, sound, and directing are bad that virtually unwatchable. you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with Wood, blaxploitation, 1970's horror films. After viewing this you get the feeling you've wasted hour and half your life.,\n This film, originally released Christmas, 1940, was long thought lost. very poor copy has resurfaced and made into CD, now for sale. Don't buy it! The film unspeakably terrible. The casting poor, the script awful, and the directing dreadful.  Picture Roland Young singing and dancing. And that was the highlight.  Perhaps this movie was lost deliberately.,\n Steve Carell comes into his own his first starring role the Year Old Virgin, having only had supporting roles such films Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman, and his work the Daily Show, had only gotten small taste the comedy that Carell truly makes his own. You can tell that Will Ferrell influenced his \"comedic air\" but Carell takes another level, everything does innocent, lovable, and hilarious. would not hesitate say that Steve Carell one the next great comedians our time.  The Year Old Virgin two hours non-stop laughs (or hours you see twice like did), perfect supporting cast and great leads charm the audience through the entire movie. The script was perfect with many great lines that you will want see the movie again just try remember them all. The music fit the tone the movie great, and you can tell the director knew what was doing.  Filled with sex jokes, some nudity, and lot language, this movie isn't for everyone but you liked the Wedding Crashers, Anchorman, any movie along those lines, you will absolutely love The Year Old Virgin.,\n Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy stars this, one his weakest werewolf films... but bear with for moment. Most people will familiar with under its most common television title, THE FURY THE WOLF MAN, and there have been many home video versions over the years. you want serious about giving fair shot though, the most workable edition I've seen goes the title THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS, and it's unedited and complete European version which restores couple disturbing scenes and contains the original nude shots which are missing from FURY's print. also letterboxed.  Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky, returning home from trip Tibet only find out that he's contracted werewolf curse and that his wife has been having affair. takes care her and her lover while animal form, but then becomes guinea pig for sexy woman doctor and her female assistant. Apparently, the doc attempts \"tame\" the werewolf, and there very strange sado-masochistic love scene between her and the hairy and fanged Daninsky who under her trance, least the original version. Ultimately get two werewolves for the price one Daninsky battles she-wolf!   The biggest problem with the movie that the director (according Naschy's claims) was often drunk, and the results are indeed rather incoherent. When watching THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS copy, it's not quite difficult make out what's going on, though the editing remains atrocious spots. Worst all occasional non-matching footage Naschy's ravenous werewolf swiped straight from another previous film (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, aka \"FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR\") and mixed into this one without any sensible reason! The wolf's clothing changes from black shirt white and back again, does his demeanor; one moment the wolf walking around lethargically hypnotic trance from FURY, next growling and running around savagely from BLOODY TERROR. Really bizarre.,\n Brides are dying the altar and their corpses are vanishing. one knows why who, but investigative reporter (Luana Walters) notes that each bride was wearing strange orchid and she goes interview its creator, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now Dr. Lorenz mad scientist with some strange habits, including sleeping coffins and injecting his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) with the fluid young brides keep her young.  The Corpse Vanishes has interesting premise and short enough run time that shouldn't able get boring. Unfortunately, while starts off quite well, does start drag before the halfway point and gets rather boring with its clichés and predictable plot.  There are some good things about it-Bela Lugosi charming and evil and performs brilliantly; Elizabeth Russell also beautiful, suave, aloof and very creepy countess; and I'm always fan Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters also convincing the reporter here.  It maintains bit Gothic atmosphere and the sets are decent.  But overall, just didn't manage hold interest through the whole picture, and for that, have rate poorly.,\n gave the point where George Clooney's character has his finger-nails extracted. were not squeamish having sat through hour this drivel just knew what felt like. say this film was incomprehensible, boring, pretentious twaddle would over-praise it! How did people manage sit through this confusing, slow, depressing pseud's corner film, let alone nominate for Oscar? Clooney looked ill felt watching him. What was thinking? and what was with those subtitles? did just have dud DVD was the original film done like that sentences left hanging mid-air? The film was hard enough follow without that well. pity the cast, who obviously did their best with the material available.,\n like this movie most you must a)strongly love (without marriage) acknowledge English humor which about admiring gallant and witty life situations and not just running gags fairly very intelligent, because authors gave opportunity laugh and cry over every single minute this movie, and only you meet \"b\" and \"c\" requirements, you can recognize and enjoy author's input. fully enjoy the movie you must love women like Kirsted Dunst, who natural, sweet and irresistible. e)you must admire creative, little melancholic people with great and remarkable personalities  if you meet all these requirements you'll likely rate this movie near points.  I never laughed half(!) much from watching this masterpiece. And even managed cry while laughing some moments always get sensitive, whenever good things happen Kirsten Dunst),\n This was one the most ridiculous and badly directed movies I've seen very long time. I've never liked Spike Lee, but thought I'd give this one try: bad mistake. The movie supposed show how the Son Sam real life murders affected neighborhood the summer 1977; what really did was center around the most boring characters that doubt anyone cared for far their drug problems, marriage problems, and on, etc. The scenes that depict the murders are just that, and nothing more; shooting and then it's back Saturday Night Fever! What's even more ridiculous Spike Lee's choice show reporter the movie: Spike, trust me, you're Hitchcock, stay out the movies, makes them even worse off. The most silly scene had the dog speaking goofy voice, which was depicted scene before where was supposed have been shot??? Spike, what were you thinking when you made this film? Not thinking all guess. People who think they'll see crime drama, take advice and not waste your time money this loser. You're better off watching Jerry Springer this case! Waste film, gave out 10: awful dud.,\n The cover the DVD and disc freaking awesome, you would think they made movie about sweet tooth from twisted metal black which still really great idea, but this movie's actors are worst then Ben's performance pearl harbor, porno's have better quality and better actors. was gonna buy the DVD but luckily rented first, the plot and script are also horrible, nothing seems together the movie really never makes sense. The poor attempts frighten you using flashback scenes are worse then ones used 80's sitcom shows and the end it'll leave you wanting bang your head against the wall your house.,\n saw this movie with family and was great! This film more than just documentary (that offers not more than cold facts) with long mono/-duologue's and lots charts...The complete \"power\" this movie comes from the impressive pictures being filmed under water, the air the Arctic.With watching this movie you can learn more about our planet than with just reading book, shows that are embedded the circular flow life. This movie not only for \"environmental fanatics\" although people that want look good movie with message should watch it. This movie taught that are not only living the earth...we live with and through the earth and all plants and animals grow and die with us.,\n After being forced sit through some real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) truly enjoyed watching \"Fried Worms\". For once, did not guess the ending! was funny and entertaining and didn't resort ton gross-out humor, despite the title. boys and 10) both LOVED too and year old \"boy\" had smile his face the whole time. This family movie that not just tolerable for the parents. The relationship with the little brother close real life. \"He not stopping singing just annoy me!!\" Also, the way the new kid tries make friends and how those friendships actually form right-on with the way kids behave. course the parents have act little goofy but favorite scenes involved the Dad getting used his new job. Have fun!,\n First bough this movie VHS than just had buy dvd, favorite movies all time. have read the book, but really think the movie much better. loved Gwyneth Paltrow Emma and Jeremy Northam Mr. Knightley was excellent chose. was brilliant!  It's 10/10 movie!!! <br,\n Bashki should congratulated for attempting convert one the great works English fiction into movie, and then slapped silly for this attempt. The animation was poor, the characters looked ridiculous, the music was overwhelmingly blaring, and the film was ramshackle blitz through the first book and half Tolkien's masterpiece. can still remember sheer disappointment and loathing for the movie when first saw it. Now realize that any attempt convert book into movie bound fail many ways, simply because the medium, but this movie, regardless the source the story, just plain pathetic. Bashki capable much more.,\n Several features this film immediately date it. The sound rather shrill and one realizes what great strides have been accomplished sound reproduction the ensuing years. The language the dialogue rather quaint and unnatural and the acting still reminiscent its transition from the stage techniques.  Bette Davis always gives strong performance all her films she does this early period her very successful career. feel however that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression. think the assumed cockney accent that does not ring true for me.  Somerset Maughan loves delve into human relationships great dramatic intensity which will please all movie-goers. many her character roles, Bette Davis can switch from beautiful seductive woman viper full fiery hatred. Leslie Howard well cast the withdrawn English artist with club foot desperately seeking partner and making bad choice scheming little waitress.  Towards the end the film the young doctor meets his true love busy street. They cross through the traffic completely oblivious multitude horns and whistles screaming them. This scene possibly meant funny, but find quite ridiculous this otherwise very serious film. probably construed send you home with smile your face. And after all far can see (and hope for) happy ending.,\n Hollywood North satirical look the time Canadian film history when the Canadian government offered huge tax breaks for films made Canada. Most the time was treated tax shelter cheap way get American films made. For example, Porky's came out it. Anyways Matthew Modine plays novice producer who wants make adaptation beloved Canadian novel. However, order get the money needs American name star. gets loose cannon and learns has compromise the point where the film longer resembles the book was originally based on. plays well Canada but may not understood outside the Great White North. Americans will think we're satirizing ourselves but will miss the point that we're actually satirizing them. For Canadians 8/10 for the rest the world 5/10.,\n the opinion several friends and family members, including myself, this the finest the entire gamut Tarzan movies. Johnny Weissmuller never played the part well the following issues the series. definitely rates \"10\" collection films.,\n yeah right. Sammo Hung already acted the main role 1983's \"Zu Warrios from the Magic Mountain\". Now, 2001, does again with \"Zu Warriors\". But this time, finally does right. You seldom see him wuxia, more often classic eastern crime slapstick. But this role simply does fit him! The ancient Chinese legend about mountain not often represented movies (as far know about movies translated for the west). Although, the legend contains vast interesting stories and possibilities. Straight said: you haven't seen story alike yet modern movie! And that makes great! And wow: all the colors plus the enormously deep, right-into-the-heart going story makes you fall for this movie instant. The first time watched it, had watch again instantly, and did. true, didn't understand all the first time. But that makes only better! You know, you didn't understand all it, because there much spice it! Therefor pleasure for one self watch over and over again. And yeah, grows deeper your heart, the more often you watch it.  Summary: story love, characters you cry with, and truly: movie you never forget! Editors note: well, think must watch right now again,\n Gorgeous Techicolor production telling the unusual tale the romance between woman strong religious faith and Trappist monk who has left his monastery, breaking his vows. The film opens convent Europe, where former student prays lonely beauty black named Domini (Marlene Dietrich). She advised the Mother Superior the desert and \"find herself\", and lose her grief over her father who has recently died. the train car the way into the Sahara she sits opposite very, very troubled man (Charles Boyer) our former monk. She's soon hotel near palm-treed oasis where she again sees our mysterious troubled man stumped over what when confronted very seductive dancing girl. Domini becomes friends with him, though knows nothing his past romance soon follow.  This film sentimental, melodramatic, and different (in way, almost surreal and even bit campy) found quite fun and entertaining. The photography this really interesting full extreme facial close-ups and beautiful color shots caravans horses crossing the desert, silhouetted figures against sunset sky. Marlene Dietrich gives nicely done, though restrained, performance here and looks gorgeous. Charles Boyer not usually one favorites actually pretty good this, think the part sort suits him and looks quite young and handsome too. Basil Rathbone fine here, except given very little do. Another great orchestral score Max Steiner helps keep the drama rolling all all, very enjoyable film.,\n loved this excellent movie. Farrah Fawcett played the part phenomenally and with good heart. She plays woman who driven extreme measures protect herself and her friends after she attacked stranger. After being rejected the police she realizes she her own.  Then one day when she home alone the stranger breaks into her home and attacks her again. Not being about call the police get him out she forced spray him the eyes and imprisons him her fireplace.  I think there need for wake call the laws the land. They are too easy these criminals. It's time for more harsh punishments.,\n someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued this fascinating true-life tale, was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way the good story should have been.  THE BAD I'm fan Robert Duvall and many the characters has played, but his role here dull one insurance investigator.  The dialog insipid and the pretty Kathryn Harrold real garbage-mouth. From what read, there were several directors replacing each other this film, and that's too bad. You can tell things aren't right with the story. couldn't get \"involved\" with Treat Williams' portrayal Cooper, either. should have been fascinating, but wasn't this movie. It's also kind sad comment that guy committing crime some sort \"folk hero,\" but admit wound rooting for the guy, too.  Not everything was disappointing. can't complain about the scenery, from the lush, green forests Oregon the desert Arizona.  I'd like see this movie re-made and done better, because one-of-a-kind story.,\n This movie should not watched was meant flop. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted make this remake classic bollywood movie \"Sholay\", but after having problems with the original makers decided ahead with the project and... guess leave all the good parts the movie (acting, script, songs, music, comedy, action etc) out and shoot the movie just because already happen hire the crew. Waste money, waste time. After making movies like Rangeela, Satya, and Company pulled Coppola (Godfather) us; What were you thinking RGV? Anyways, the story is, though hard follow, almost like the Old sholay. Ajay Devgan playing Heero (Beeru, sholay) and Ajay, new kid the block playing Ajay (Jay,sholay). Both \"bad yet funny\" friends help cop capture bad guy first. Later the movie, now Retired cop hires them personal security and safeguarding from the hands very most wanted Bubban played Amitabh Bachan. case you haven't been watching Bollywood movies, the Good guys win the end. There just saved you precious hours your life!,\n Carlito Way, the original brilliant story about ex-drug dealer who hopes leave his criminal past and invests club and the deals with the trouble that comes with it.  This film was....  I saw the trailer and knew instantly was going bad..But after dismissing films the past and finding out they were great( Lucky Number Slevin, Tokyo Drift)...I gave this shot and failed within the first five minutes...  The script something teenager would come with given five minutes prepare...It was weak, with weaker dialogue. seems there instant need for romance gangster movie. Brigante decides beat guy for the girl....and she say's 'Yes!' And you need act bad just throw racism around...As learn from the 'Italian mobsters'...  The acting was terrible say the least...I found 'Hollywood Nicky', hilarious.  I absolutely hate all these musicians turning movies. Lets face the only reason Diddy did this movie was could play gangsters...The actress who plays Leticia was weak but beautiful. The sex scene was weak but got see her..which was okay...  But overall expected shed light how Carito ended prison and the love his life...And the assassin towards the end completely added the horrendous movie that is...  Carlito's Way: Rise Power..,\n Horrible film. About old crusty painter who hangs around with young girl. Boring. Tatum Neil goes through the motions her part, and has some the corniest lines film history. Richard Burton looks close death this film, and we're supposed believe looks \"Good for sixty\". The acting bad, the plot. The characters are awful, the story. It's really hard feel for anyone this film, except Larry Ewashen who plays guy porno theater who hits Tatum, he's kind funny. This movie really waste time. you are Tatum fan, like which why rented the first place please don't see this movie. She really bad it, and you'll wonder maybe PAPER MOON was fluke. wasn't, because BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS it's known she can act well, but still, don't rent this movie. And you're fan Burton, rent something when was good looking, and not fossil.,\n Sure, you ask any mom who's the most beautiful baby the world, she'd tell you her son the most amazing kid the whole world. She's right, least her own world.  The producers the movie were biggie's mother and his good friend Puffy. Oh, well, need say more? I'll break down for those who doesn't want simple deduction.  The whole movie was fake. You may just put few biggie's MTV video together and call movie.  The beautiful Angela Bassett played Biggie's mother. The real one life looks like dog.  I just wonder why called himself biggie small. Big body Small dick? Big mouth Small sound? Big fat Small eyes? Disclaimer: I'm person color. keep your racist remark yourself.,\n really enjoyed this movie. The acting the adult actors was great, although did find the main kid little stiff. But carried himself very well for being new talent. The humor very sublime and not your face like most Hollywood comedy junk. I.e. The Nutty Professor. you have short attention span and are used the typical Hollywood stuff you probably wouldn't like this bit slower paced. picked Blu-ray and have say the image quality top notch. Probably one the better looking Blu-rays I've seen far. The extras were cool too. They deleted quite bit, but that's probably good thing most the deleted scenes didn't really add anything.,\n may have seen worse films than this, but have, don't remember. possibly blocked them out. Who knows,if was undergo hypnotherapy, may remember them, along, maybe, with been abducted aliens child, other traumas. so, would happily exchange those memories for the ones have watching this film.  I should give the film some credit: did produce emotional response. actually started become angry scenes that spoofed other films and programs, that this travesty was dirtying them association. terrified that may unable watch films like Strangelove again without this film flitting across minds eye.,\n Billy Crystal normally brings the crowd laughter, but this movie and all the rest them cannot bring any smile face.... perhaps just one. They call comedy, say it's waste time.,\n And that's bad thing, because least this had been Troma film, would have had wanton violence and greater sense anarchic abandon that might have brought rating bit.  So what have instead very tame (rated PG), barely lukewarm, low budget (Roger Corman produced with unknown director who has subsequently remained unknown) Gremlins (1984)/Critters (1986)-wannabe with almost exclusively flat humor, little the logic that made Gremlins work well--fantasy logic not, suspense, sense adventure, and violence nudity make for it.  Although I'm sure some the problems with the film are inherent the script--let's face it, one could deliver these jokes that they would funny--it seems like the biggest blame has fall into the lap the director, Bettina Hirsch. more capable hands, Munchies could have been entertaining.  After all, starts out like many great adventure films. Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are Peru archaeological dig. Simon bit wacky archaeologist who always floating theories about the connections between ancient sites and alien civilizations. For example, thinks sees evidence laser-cutting ancient stonework. they're Machu Picchu looking for more evidence Simon's theories when they happen upon secret chamber. Inside they quickly find the animal they later dub \"Arnold\", one the titular munchies.  They take Arnold back home their small California desert town. Simon, who thinks that Arnold probably alien creature, has off colleague's lecture, and plans telling the colleague that finally has alien specimen. Paul and his extremely cute girlfriend, Cindy (Nadine Van der Velde), are left charge Arnold, but they haven't seen each other long time, they leave Arnold unsupervised while they hop the sack.  Meanwhile, Simon's brother Cecil (played also Korman dual role), owner successful snack foods company, eager buy off Simon's home and land--they're adjacent his own. Simon doesn't want sell, Cecil hits upon scheme steal Arnold. Things gradually spiral out control, and the munchies, who have mean streak along with their cravings for junk food, begin overrun the town.  That reads better summary than plays the screen. The best shots the film are those with natural landscapes the background, such when characters are driving the outskirts the desert town. Interiors, with the exception Cecil's home, tend look like poorly decorated, cheap sets, and more importantly, they tend show that Hirsch not very skilled blocking and setting shots. Oddly, given the paucity the production design overall, Cecil's home quite gem, imbued overblown 1980s style down the smallest details, and Cecil's stepson, Dude (Jon Stafford), was amusing counterpoint. Too bad, then, that he's out the film quickly.  At any rate, Korman fun actor, but comes across much better here Simon than Cecil. Unfortunately, Simon ends being absent for most the film. Cecil, who differentiated physically ridiculous wig and facial hair, not only the \"evil capitalist\" the film, he's one Korman's classic inconsiderate, boorish characters--that was one his specialties, frequently capitalized \"Carol Burnett Show\" (1967) skits. Unlike \"The Carol Burnett Show\", which tended succeed because directors Clark Jones and Dave Powers had studied way pushing the skits just the brink chaos, Hirsch reins Korman way too far, and the Cecil character just doesn't work the way should.  There are lot other director-related problems, not the least which wonky pacing and editing, which completely sap any possible suspense compelling dramatic impact from the film. Even scenes that should have been shoe-ins for amping the drama--such when the munchies are harassing old lady the road--are put together far too awkwardly have much affect.  There are also serious logical problems with the story stands. Where did the munchie the chamber Machu Picchu come from? The film's trailer seems show answer this, but was edited out the final cut. more serious problem that, unlike gremlins, there clear reason for munchies from cute, cuddly furballs menacing monsters. just happens. Further, because Munchies was kept PG, and the violence remains toned down, when the creatures are their monster phase, they're never very threatening. They're also easily dispatched, least temporarily.  Admittedly, the gist the film isn't suspense, horror, compelling drama any that other stuff, but humor. It's intended more spoof Gremlins and the countless rip-offs its wake. The only problem with that that the film just isn't funny, even though chuckled couple times. surprisingly high percentage the jokes are bland clichés. Too much the remaining material consists non-sequiturs. Given bad timing from Hirsch, all just falls flat. There was potential make film that while spoof, was both funny and frightening, hilarious and disturbing, cheesy and suspenseful, all the same time, ala Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988). Too bad, then, that Munchies comes nowhere near that.,\n House Games spell binding. It's nice occasionally see films that are perfect tens. There are few movies I've seen that can grip you quickly. From the opening scene this movie just gets you.  I'm trying really hard not give much away those who may not yet have seen this but there will FEW SPOILERS DON'T READ ANYMORE YOU DON'T WANT KNOW.  I would say House Games not just superb film but the best movie about con artists have ever seen-bar none. From the moment the movie over begs replayed.  Lindsay Crouse Margaret Ford simply perfection, from her mannerisms the inflection her voice she gets into the role immediately. Joe Mantegna was also wonderful. The dialogue this movie has unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate much look they with their voices. also loved the way the movie was filmed, that grainy, surreal type way, fit perfectly and helped make the film what was.  There were few movies I've seen and loved that this reminded including The Grifters and The usual Suspects but really, House games completely different it's way. Margaret and Mike are two the most absorbing characters I've seen the big screen and not only they have screen chemistry that strong and palpable from the moment they meet, but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes each other electrifying. You know something's going happen but you have idea what. And just when you think you've guessed what the \"something\" is, you realize you haven't even scratched the surface....  House Games one those movies that may lumped certain genre movie type but essentially movie about human nature. The character study not just about the mind the con artist but the victim well. the movie moves along and get know more and more about the main characters, learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it. great character study and flawless the way speeds it's conclusion.  In closing, I'd rank this 10, call (although not absolute favorite film, pretty high the list), most definitely outstanding and would far say does rank one the best character studies and contains some the best \"twists\" I've ever seen well. Although love all types and genres movies, when comes movies the human psyche, really doesn't get much better then this. See this movie.,\n Saw this movie the Rotterdam IFF. You may question some decisions the maker like choosing mockumentary form for such sensitive and horrible subject but this movie sure hits you the gut. Especially the last scenes were almost painful watch. Hope gets the distribution deserves.,\n This such great movie watch with young children. I'm always looking for excuse watch over over. Gena was good, Cheech was fun,the Russian was good, Maria was adorable course Paulie was the best!,\n The ultimate homage great film actress.The film masterpiece poetry the screen.Like great poetry timeless.Direction,cast,screenplay,music,lyrics,in fact all the norms for movie-making are perfectly chosen suit the message the film.The Muslim society India has never been presented with such respect,nobility and reality.The script memorable the hands Meena,Ashok,Raaj Kumar,Nadira etc name few.Personally was most impressed the regal looking Kamal Kapoor.The master movie maker Kamal Amrohi's lasting legacy the sub-continent.A very beautiful film controversial theme that makes humanity look and face the reality the outcasts the world.'In naam? Pakeeza! haan Pakeza'.Such acting unheard this age sex,dance and pornography.,\n Despite much style, flash, and glitter, this French musical fails speak. The tunes are repetitive, predictable, and tedious. The story uninteresting, are the many characters.   People break into song and dance, without motivation reason. Most the cast wears phony looking wigs and hairpieces, and the sets look hopelessly studio bound.  To honest, this video the restored version was stopped before the end, negative effect had me. Certainly shame, have such multi-talented cast feeble final effort.   Goes show, guess, where followups (in this case, the great classic, \"Umbrellas\") often awry. One cannot recapture, only recreate.,\n \"May Contain Spoilers*  \"All Dogs Heaven\" great movie. saw 1989 when was two years old. didn't understand that well but saw more and more times started love it. love the songs this movie. favorite songs are \"Let Surprised\" and \"Soon You'll Come Home\". Those are beautiful songs. The only thing that bothers about the movie Charlie dieing. When was little sister couldn't even watch that part. Other than that this movie wonderful.   My favorite part the movie when Annabelle and Charlie are flying around heaven. Heaven beautiful the movie and the \"clocks\" are very clever. also love Itchy, fact have dachshunds own. They are cute.   Overall love this movie and suggest everyone should see it. give this movie 10/10 stars.,\n can't remember many films where bumbling idiot hero was funny throughout. Leslie Cheung such the antithesis hero that he's too dense seduced gorgeous vampire... had the good luck see big screen, and find video watch again and again. 9/10,\n This movie horrible. THe acting waste basket. crying, action, hopeless songs. Though the scenery great. have always wanted Greece.  Anyway, for Saif, you'd expect great performance, but even let down the people.  Akshay Kumar, recognized the pimp Bollywood and the voice Singhs. was sensational this movie. For only this performance, Filmfare should introduce another award. The toiletries award for the worst performance. the way the trophy should toilet seat.  Kareena Kapoor. She first all not comparable her sister Karisma. acting, looks, body. She now wants prove herself that she surpasses her. She comes into this movie wearing bikini's and tank tops and short shorts. really wonder why Saif Ali Khan letting his wife-to-be dress like that. But, she must've impressed some people dressing like that. And you ask how, then consider every man having erection watching this movie. They are dreaming having Kareena Kapoor bed naked with condom. Including me. Personally think that she dressed like whore, but really liked it.  I forced give 1/10, but I'd really give this movie 0/10. unachieved film.,\n friend mine lent this video and was fairly excited watch it, but after ten minutes James Hetfield's slow pitched vocals and Lars banging his drum set what appeared slow motion began think, `Why watching this?' That question will coursing through your minds minutes after you hit Play. gave the tape back the same day, you would suspect, not worth buying watching!  Just opinion! <br,\n you ask the first one was really better one. Look Sarah G., she real, mean, cruel girl, look Amy Adams she just little fool hanging around. She nothing! People don't adore her! Second, Sebastian was cute and hot first movie, now \"baby face\". Story not that good, and not understand. Why didn't they make this one first, the beginning. Loosy actors, nothing with story. This not cruel, this playing. First one has better actors, better story, and its mean. think that the music better cruel intentions and the music better cruel intentions not the worst movie saw, but compaer with first one its one big, big, big nothing.,\n write review about movie, maybe will stick with me... but generally expect that will have forgotten I've seen this one mere two weeks from now. why bother? Because again find myself watching low-rated movie that was fun watch. didn't expect I'd able stay the room while was on.  It wasn't great, but least was not unbearable... not comedy errors which always makes cringe. was just sweet fluff... and you can't take it, stay the locker room boys. agree with those who defend this movie because sure please its targeted demographic, and won't total bore adult.  It offers few good chuckles here and there, but nary side splitter. Sure silly and only mildly entertaining, but least doesn't suck (as many have said does). Maybe those folks are afraid their sensitive sides?   I have tendency grade the bell curve, 4,5 actually okay all-around rating book. Giving makes sense and will bolster its rating the time this writing. Giving 10, most have done thus far, makes the rating numbers meaningless. cannot believe how strongly people feel one way the other about this forgettable fluff (or that even bothering write about it). missing something?   Anyway, should noted that Emma Roberts performs her role Clairedycat quite convincingly. Ariell Kebbel often written into b*ch roles does not disappoint when her character gets her due. You might also recognize Bruce Spence playing Leonard, though his role ancillary.  Surely you can miss this one you are adult. But, there pre-teen girl your life, rent this movie for her... and prepared NOT hate (you might even enjoy it).,\n have loved this movie all life. It's such intelligent story also, with plenty classical allusions. eg. The ship that went missing decades earlier was called the Bellerophon. Well, classical mythology this was the man who slew the Chimera, legendary beast composed two more other creatures. FP, Walter Pidgeon clearly the chimera- himself and his monster.   I like movies where the writers have clearly credited their audiences with modicum intelligence, unlike most modern blockbusters which spend $150m special effects, but about $1.50 screenplay.  Cheers,\n This film really vile. plays the urban paranoia the 70s/80s and puts into school context. I'm not saying that urban crime wasn't problem for lot people that schools weren't/aren't problem areas but this vile piece exploitation takes the biscuit. Violence beyond anything realistically imaginable but this case it's not case social issues but white, upper-middle class student uses turn himself into the crime kingpin his local high schoiol. And course knows how play the system. Does that sound familiar. Yes. This turd pure violent exploitation, really nasty piece work. It's disturbing brutality dressed social comment. This belongs the same category trash like Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and and on. The only remarkable thing that Michael Fox was broke the time that had stuff like this.,\n Jean Luc Godard's Marxist polemic close unwatchable film you're likely see from internationally respected filmmaker. Bits political theater, mind-numbingly boring and interminable, are interspersed with the making \"Sympathy for the Devil\", featuring the Rolling Stones the studio.  The process the song's development, from Mick Jagger playing demo acoustic guitar, the backing vocals being recorded towards the end, fascinating, and it's worth renting this film just see the bits with the Stones. Almost half the movie devoted this, thanks the miracle chapter stops, you can skip all the bizarre political skits and just watch the Stones put song together.  When had this laserdisc, valiantly attempted watch all, but don't see how anyone could get through it. finally gave and just chapter-skipped way the Stones segments.,\n have seen couple movies eating disorders but this one was definitely favorite one. The problem with the other ones was that the people with the eating disorders towards the end just automatically get better accept the fact that they need help and thats it. this movie thought was more realistic cause this one the main character Lexi doesn't automatically just get better. She gets better and then has drawback. think this movie shows more than the others that I've seen that getting better doesn't just happen, it's hard work and takes time, it's long path recovery. think this movie shows all that very well. There should more movies like this.,\n Oh, brother. The only reason this very irritating film avoids getting the total \"bomb\" from because it's least historically noteworthy the first Three Stooges film (when they weren't yet their own and were still saddled with that painfully unfunny Ted Healy). But even longtime Stooges fan I'd have say that young Moe, Larry and Curly are badly used here three zany assistant janitors Mr. Healy's taller boss janitor. They're not featured steadily through the movie and their silly on-and-off-again stints paint them more like zany overactive cartoon characters trying too hard amusing.  Most this toothache deals with Jack Pearl seeking vain get some chuckles from the audience himself man who impersonates Baron Munchausen (here's good example the level humor: object!\" \"On what grounds?\" \"Coffee grounds!\"). His sidekick none other than young Jimmy Durante, but even the schnoz himself bore.,\n Poor performances Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. Grossly underdeveloped supporting characters. Annoying talky with real plot. Ending leaves you flatter than pancake, with more loose ends than you could tie four sequels (that is, you even cared about these wooden characters). MacLaine the only real asset. That penultimate sequence which the \"Chicago hood\" searches for the Sinatra character laughable. The music that sequence also poor. And the final scene when Martin's character removes his hat for the woman called \"pig,\" almost made outside and find stone throw through television screen.,\n This film pulls you from the get-go because grabs our attention acknowledging, yeah, that this story opening with cliché funeral.  In hands other than Judi's wouldn't have given this material has been done over and over again: The great reunion once famous, pick one please, team, army platoon, theatre group, singers, band.  But this movie never stoops cheap sentimentalization, and when you think going swoops off another direction. case point the flowers that are sent admirer Judi.  The band members are interesting group and ride above the clichés too. One jail, one has found religion, one alkie, and one has sunk into dementia. But the joie vivre rediscovered Judi, ignited her granddaughter's interest, carries along and makes overlook the sometimes simplistic nature the plot.  The cast are who's who talent, Leslie Caron, the incomparable jazzist Cleo Laine with her amazing high notes, last performance from Joan Sims, brava Joan, cute button flirtatious Ian Holm having ball, and Olympia Dukakis money-grabbing divorcée living the highlands Scotland with her ghillie and her whiskey, The closing scene standard Hollywoodland fare, the judgmental children the star converted fun-loving supporters, the old lovers reunited, the youngsters swept the old timers' music. Life should this simple. But would watch again, and intend to, with own granddaughter. For the right hands, sometimes one just loves these brazen old clichés. out 10.,\n was excited view Cataluña´s film the Berlin´s competition. But after the presentation was total disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too much themes for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was horrible. The revenge, very human behavior, not pretty all, shown uncountable films and plays, well the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism Spain about Catholicism But what Villaronga try, pseudo tragedy that can belongs the worst the film´s history. really pity see Angela Molina this movie. advise nobody under circumstances see this film.,\n with all Angelopoulos' films, \"The Suspended Step the Stork\" implicitly demands close and intimate participation the part the viewer, fact that has certainly contributed the limited popularity his work. Dialogues are sparing, with monologues exchanges exteriorizing the characters' inner conflicts, doubts, feelings. The filmmaker prefers keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses, and instead forces them explore and study the characters' identities for themselves. result, the acting understated and implicit, opposed overt and explicit.  The action scenes are set between long intervals contemplation, where the viewer asked become participant, participate actor, probing his her own psyche. novel, where the drama rests entirely the author's writing provide template where the reader's imagination and/or past experience flourish, Angelopoulos' drama rests within his images: his uses the long shots, the long takes, the leisurely pacing, the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark, inviting the viewer experience the film from his her personal perspective. Angelopoulos uses silence capture moments high intensity, reverting the non-verbal language gestures, gazes, sounds, and music, when believes that words can only take far.  The music, Angelopoulos' long time collaborator, Eleni Karaindrou, provides more than just discreet background, but becomes itself dramatic element the story. large part the film consists exterior shots subtle, subdued colors, recorded drab winter light. Angelopoulos presents with \"other Greece,\" one far different from the Greece the tourist brochures, with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas, drowned eternal sunshine. Here, the skies are covered and gray, the air cold and misty, and the sands the pristine beaches have been replaced the trampled, dirty snow the village streets. Angelopoulos' genius through Arvanitis' camera display throughout the film.  \"The Suspended Step the Stork\" above all else political statement aimed the socio-political situation the Balkans the end the twentieth century. deeply concerned with the meaning \"borders,\" and with those who are the victims the confusion between nations. the \"waiting room\" facing the Albanian border, the refugees, political other, outcast the rest humanity, wait. They may stuck against political border, but unfortunately they still carry with them, and hang on, deeper ancestral borders: those the languages, the customs, and the races. Although Angelopoulos' political views are well known, the film steers clear any political discourse regarding the causes the refugees' plights. the process, Angelopoulos forces meditate the concepts geographical, cultural, political, and personal \"borders.\"   Angelopoulos considers himself historian twentieth century Greece, and likes bring lessons from the Hellenic myths into his discussions. this film, does some border crossing himself between the Greek and Italian cultures, drawing from combined Homeric and Dantesque tradition Odysseus' travel. Alexander Telemachus, search story about aging Greek politician/Odysseus who disappeared, never heard again. This political man, brilliant orator, unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort his bourgeois existence, his wife, and his brilliant career, live anonymously refugee camp with the lowest the low. became poet exile wondering how change the world. course, the \"politician\" not Alexander's father, but the \"politician\" stands before Alexander like father figure/Odysseus. with Homer's Telemachus, Alexander grows person during his odyssey.  Of course, would wrong try and see the film retelling Homer's Odyssey contemporary context. Angelopoulos draws Odysseus's travels only structuring and thematic elements for his film. Angelopoulos' ending, \"Odysseus\" more like the Dante's Odysseus: does not leave for Ithaca but goes on, \"carrying suitcase.\" And Alexander/Telemachus \"suspended\" between returning his home and his career, embarking voyage \"somewhere else.\" states much, voice-over the beginning the film, paraphrasing few lines from Dante's \"Inferno\": \"And don't forget that the time for voyage has come again. The wind blows your eyes far away.\"   Finally, although Angelopoulos not religious person, there Greek Orthodox religious theme introduced during the film the form the yellow-suited linesmen, who around bettering things for their fellow human beings reconnecting communications, and also the Christ-like figure the \"politician.\" the final scene, these men yellow demonstrate once more the Byzantine iconography's influence Angelopoulos' work. They appear like \"stylites,\" religious figures found the Orthodox tradition, solitary and fervent men who took their abode upon the tops pillars, form asceticism.  The film ends without resolution the true identity the character played Mastroianni. Angelopoulos does not give any clues, and the wife's statement, \"It's not him,\" far from convincing and left ambiguous enough. The important question the film not whether not the vanished politician, but that could the politician. But the film still ends optimistic note. Whereas the wires strung from pole pole run only along the river, and thus communications across the border are still not possible, and remains impenetrable, note that this final scene taken from point view across the river: the camera has crossed the border, and the reverse tracking shot inviting Alexander and the viewer follow beyond the boundary. this account, Angelopoulos gives hope that somehow, some the borders will eventually crumble.,\n This movie was just heckled MST3K and with good reason. First and foremost because \"cop\" movie starring Joe Don Baker, who all know about good cop actor Michael Jackson country western singer.  All the typical cop movie plot devices rear their ugly heads, bar fights, children hostages shoot outs, bad acting, lame police chiefs, bad acting, revenge/justice, endless goons and course, bad acting. Don't watch this without MST3K filter folks.,\n can't think much say about this film.   This was awful movie...I can't even tell you what made decide view it. had few redeeming qualities that don't even know where begin.  The plot moved from implausible downright absurd. entire body was tense throughout the duration the movie because could not wait for the awful thing over and done. the end the movie, found myself feeling beyond relieved.   The editing was poor, the acting was sub-par, and the storyline was weak. Francoise Robinson was cast Native American, even though she does not even closely resemble someone Native American heritage.   If movie going this idiotic, should laughably stupid the very least. wasn't. was just pathetic.,\n very open foreign films and like think that grasp what they are trying accomplish although some things are lost translation. But the simplicity and \"intelligence\" this film were boring. I've often thought how interesting would make movie that just shows typical day time period that really had point. Now that I've seen movie like that will longer thinking along those lines. There's tones about society, racism, and some desire...but South Park has that. And when watch South Park actually moves feel emotion. The closest thing felt emotion during this movie was the yawn experienced after the first five minutes. rate the typical movie seven above because love most every film. gave this film one.,\n There's shortage bad dialogue David and Bathsheba was quite hand with slingshot,\" \"The King all Israel out there the darkness exposing himself the enemy\" (full marks Dennis Hooey for delivering that one with straight face), \"Go and sit with the concubines.\" And somehow doubt bored David ever told the prophet Nathan \"Whatever you say.\" even tries the old \"My kingdom doesn't understand me\" routine desperate housewife Bathsheba one point. it's probably tribute Henry King's direction that the film isn't all bad despite the pitfalls much the first third provide. Maybe it's the censor-baiting nature the plot married man kills femme fatale's husband and gets away with it! but King brings out the growing moral and theological complexities Phillip Dunne's script rather than upping the sin and sandals hokum. This the conflicted David the downhill slope, abandoned vengeful God longer understands, and the film doesn't back away from the awkward unanswerable questions about why loving deity would choose wreak vengeance the innocent rather than the guilty. even offers genuinely surprising criticism the sexual inequality the law, where the failings husbands result the punishment their wives.  Unlike King David, which sidelined the king favour the admittedly more interesting Saul, David firmly the centre the drama and despite interesting display shoulder twitching and frankly gormless overlong close-up when visiting the site Saul and Jonathan's death, Gregory Peck's performance grows stature David shrinks. Susan Hayward pure Hollywood pro, Raymond Massey appropriately theatrical prophet (why naturalistic when you've got voice that makes the very heavens quake?) and Kieron Moore's Uriah such intransigent unreconstructed chauvinist that you can't exactly blame David for putting him harm's way, but despite threatening soft peddle the film doesn't allow David moral get out jail free card over his death. With surprisingly strong but subdued design and Technicolor photography this definitely cut above most 40s-50s Biblical epics.  Fox's new DVD good transfer, including incredibly hokey 'candid' behind-the-scenes short and trailer with brief shots deleted from the film's sole battle scene.,\n This movie about animal cruelty. Under the guise marathon race, see depictions extreme animal abuse, including literally running horse death SLOW MOTION. The guy who did this then has his conscience spiritually cleansed the flames from the burial/burning the horse, which course still dead, having been tortured death. This one the sickest, slimiest movies I've ever had the displeasure viewing. Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the finish line their DYING animals, we're supposed admire their spirit for finishing the race. I'd like put the producers and director marathon race; I'll decide when they're finished, probably about minutes after they stop breathing.,\n Those childhood memories...when things were new, and were filled with curiosity about the world around us; took those initial first steps the long journey call life.

Last summer while was Korea, was able track down copy the original \"Galaxy Express 999\" (1979) DVD, and brought back lot nostalgic, heartfelt memories. \"Galaxy Express 999\" remains captivating the first time you discovered all those years ago, opening those nostalgic memories new discoveries, important stepping stone for young boys who tuned and embarked their life's journey into manhood.  Here's wonderful memories. \"Good-bye, Maetel. Good-bye, Galaxy Express 999...  Good-bye, childhood.\"  10/10,\n I'm only rating this film out pity because attempts worthwhile. love praise great movie and I'm not biased toward \"male\" movies. Legally blonde was excellent film. Georgia Rule the other hand, was disorganized, weak, poorly written, unrealistic example movie making its worst. the end the film didn't care who was lying anything was resolved.   The most important thing film good STORY. This story weak and never develops (just because the subject matter deep, doesn't mean the story good). good story has dynamic characters. dynamic character one that experiences major character change, and primed for that change over the course the movie. Georgia Rule, the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped. Secondly, there were too many ATTEMPTED dynamic characters. Pulling off really good dynamic character tough job and takes time (you've only got couple hours movie). That means that too many attempted dynamic characters will get too little attention their personal change. Even ignore the poorly written story, and the litter weak dynamic characters, can't even say liked anyone. Every character was mess. That's fine your're writing American Beauty but not when you're attempting dramatic comedy. Georgia was horrible mother, her daughter was horrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was horrible excuse for human being (no I'm not cutting her any slack because she was molested, crap happens everyone and we're all responsible for our own actions). The \"Dudley Right\" Mormon kid should have had the guts not compromise his religion and commitments...and Simon, mean seriously, what kind guy lets year old girl who's been molested just stay over occasionally (unless he's actor politician). This movie worth watching you want remind yourself what good movie making NOT!,\n loved the story. Somewhere, poster said there are families like the one portrayed this film. Well maybe there ought be. thought everybody seemed really human and believable. What top notch cast. What great music the soundtrack. What nice this, and what nice that, but most all, will say two words recommend this film.  Steve Carell.  He really showed nice, subtle depth that touched me. was truly commanding widower who had dedicated himself maybe little too much being good dad first, the cost denying his own needs.  Did act like petulant ass? Why, yes did.  And you see, that's what was perfect about this film. The actor who played this character made believe was FEELING something, and not simply ACTING like was feeling something, and conveyed perfectly what was that was feeling, and what was feeling was denied.  Denied happiness.  Denied fulfillment.  Denied love.  Losing your love painful beyond belief, and many who will never feel something like that again.  Beautiful film.  I gave eight out ten.,\n This movie horrible distortion lies and exaggerations that were put together the most shameless lunatics ever work movie. The story wrong and complete lie. There nothing this movie that accurately portrays Senator McCarthy. It's just horrible scam and amazes that anyone associated with this production ever got another job the industry. The marxist-leninists who wrote this trash did order attack man who has been vindicated history and their fear that anyone would dare destroy communism. Unfortunately for these communist nut jobs, Ronald Reagan took over where McCarthy left off and they couldn't stop him, thus the end the Soviet Union and its' cohorts.  Never, ever watch this film you're looking for truth regarding Sen. McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter's book, \"Treason\" for better look the truth about Sen. McCarthy.  It will also help you read about what really happened Senator McCarthy reading http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm,\n Remember the early days Pay Per View? do, and can almost remember the number you had CALL actually rent the movie your t.v. kid always wanted rent playboy, but this meant actually calling someone from PPV and asking rent it. And then you get the nerve and your watching four hours soft core angle crap. Well the reason bring that because this movie too was ppv. And remember almost every scene that was the add. I've been kick the last few years obtain all the great movies use see kid and this was one them. It's one that when its its hard shut off. All star cast trying commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right. There are plenty spoof bank capers that are good and this one has fall that category. has enough action and laughs sustain it. check out you dare!,\n These writings write about the end the plot don't read you haven't seen this rubbish.  I found this rubbish film the horror section which made think would horror. owned video store I'd put the BORING section. This film rubbish will make you feel like you have lost your socks.  This film contains endless shots people driving that was scary. Well drive work and back (and sometimes the store visit cats) almost every day and trust it's not scary. even starts with minutes some people driving. Even the little kid does too. Round and round goes and never stops. What's scary about watching little kid riding bicycle for hour? think NOTHING and you watch you will not think too.  The family the car arrive big castle and they are given tour just walking around endlessly looking kitchens. Then the man walks around for hour and tries kill his family for reason. That's all that happens and you can see it's rubbish.,\n They should have called this movie: \"Adopted Mouse Brother That Slightly Inspired Someone's Vague Recollection Stuart Little Who Just Kind Skimmed the Book Little, But Mostly Just Remembered the Cover\" wasn't misleading I'd give better review.  But seriously people, your kids favor and have them read the book. They might actually learn something instead having their mind numbed what all know Hollywood film.  The book Stuart little isn't about mouse, it's about person who happens very small and mouse-like. He's born his parents, not adopted. The book about his life and his eventual departure from home and the journey embarks on. There cat named Snowball who thinks he's food and wants eat him, but Snowball can't talk.   In the movie they screw all that up. think the only things that they kept from the book were the boat race and the names.,\n often band will get together for re-union concert only find that they just can't get together. Not here. This concert just shear brilliance from start finish. These three musicians obviously got together beforehand and plotted and planned what was needed ensure this was not just nostalgic bash satisfy someone's ego. This obvious from the start, before they even step stage. Many faces the crowd weren't even born when these guys first performed. From the first song they capture that old magic that was Cream, men, instruments, fuss. Clapton, his own admission, said had stretch himself for this concert because there were keyboards, synthesizers etc get see him his best. Ginger Baker demonstrates why many drummers today, speak him some sort drumming guru. Jack Bruce just great. They really managed put together piece magic that will stand the test time for many years come. This one's for me.,\n fascinating look the relationship single father 1998 and single mother 1881, tied together time-traveling teenager.

Something has happened people, they have lost the ability enjoy, simple feel-good, love story/comedy? Kirsten Dunst revelation funny, sexy and real. laughed out loud ooh least five times and I'm not ashamed say had tear eye couple times too. The cast, acting and script great, watch lot films right across the board and haven't seen one this genre that has been successful. Those who disagree please tell where can find some! I'm sure the book good too but think you have judge its own merits.,\n Scott Henderson, the engineer that employs Carol Richman, his assistant, makes point call her \"Kansas\", whenever speaks her. shows that Carol, effectively played Ella Raines, supposed babe the woods, far the Manhattan the 40s was concerned. Only woman, from out town, would follow the shady bartender solitary elevated subway. Even then, only naive girl could undertake such adventure.  Robert Siodmak directed this film noir very well. shows flair for infusing the story with lot raw sex that was surprising for those days. How else could justify the way the drummer the orchestra the musical, where Scott takes the mysterious woman with unusual hat, makes such overt pass lady date? The drummer played with high voltage Elisha Cook Jr. doesn't hide his desires for any the ladies who sat the front row the hit musical where plays. was real explicit invitation, first the \"phantom woman\" the story, Fay Helm; afterward, Cliff the drummer, insinuates himself very openly Ella Raines who goes the theater disguised the mystery dame her boss had taken originally.  This film that will hook any viewer from the beginning. There are things not explained it, but holds the one's interest throughout. The killer not revealed until the end.   Ella Raines with her expressive eyes was under estimated actress. She holds her own against much more experienced actors. Franchot Tone, New York stage actor, working Hollywood, never found this medium the fame deserved. effective the accused man's best friend. the other hand, Alan Curtis, comes across man, who when framed, accepts his fate and saved only the tenacity the woman who secretly loved him. Thomas Gomez, the inspector Burgess, asset the film detective who has his doubts the police had caught the man who committed the crime.  This movie will not disappoint.,\n watched this movie yesterday and was highly disappointed.  Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh basically had carry this awkwardly unbelievable script for five hours (or however long actually was). From the beginning, every single element this movie unbelievable. This movie made chuckle several times, but they were mainly out shock that the director/writer actually expected believe the many messy scattered elements that attempted piece this movie together.  The movie's focus Gray (Graham) and her issues with intimacy. Things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly WAY too much common.  Interesting, intriguing. However, instead unraveling this story into something believable and palatable, the director keeps taking Gray into these ludicrous twists that never actually make any sense all. Being LGBT individual, this movie seemed echo what all heterosexuals think through the coming-out process. (I'll insulted the writer's queer.) Had not been for the cute chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which, the way, was understandably forced), would give negative stars.,\n Whether you watch the regular version this monstrosity the MST3K version, you can only impressed the utter GALL that went into this production. The filmmakers insult the viewer's intelligence from one end the other and obviously couldn't care less that they are doing so.  Everything about rock-bottom cheap. Even the 1950s car the flashback sequence that era looks like was hauled out junkyard.  The \"hobgoblins\" are, you probably know, \"realized\" with badly-crafted hand puppets and stuffed toys; when person supposed attacked them, it's clear the toy being held the victim his her own body. When the critters scurry away from the two security guards, this shown (or rather, not shown) the camera aiming the guards they look down and turn their heads watching the hobgoblins scurrying past. It's reminiscent the scene the film \"Tangents\" where two people are standing the ruins future world, surveying the wreckage, and aren't shown any it. Budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you won't have anything worth showing, why try? The \"sets\" were utterly laughable. \"Club Scum\" was obvious diner; the house appears have been vacant house --probably for rent sale-- which the production company got hold for hour two the shoot. The \"spacecraft\" something would have been ashamed build when was model-making year-old.  The motivations the characters make sense-- Kevin gets denigrated his worthless ingrate girlfriend because hasn't made her \"proud him.\" I'm sure this was intended make their reconciliation touching the end, but any guy with real self-respect would have told her hell and left her. Nick supposedly back from months Army training (yeah, nice regulation haircut, Nick,) and seems bent proving that our country being defended sadistic, moronic animals who are sex maniacs. Kyle phone-sex freak red shorts who dreams night with spandex-clad dominatrix type, but he's effeminate that he's more likely gay than not. One the girls prude and the other sleaze.  And the hobgoblins? the end they all head back the vault where they've lived for years. Why? Who knows? Who cares? Watch this film and amazed how primitive film-making our modern age can when you have idiotic script, incompetent direction, actors who are bad they'd rejected from high school theater production, and sets worthy Edward Wood, Jr.,\n registered for IMDb just comment this movie.   I just got done sitting through this movie, and the only thing that impressed me, was that somehow had the will power not stop it.  I've seen pretty decent number action movies and what not, but Princess Blade has some the worst fights I've ever seen movie. Most the sword fighting involves mindlessly swinging the swords back and fourth and hoping the opponent isn't doing the same. I've seen good many student films with better action and stronger plots.  So now have \"futuristic\" action movie with poor action, and virtually sign the future.   Most the movie doesn't even have any action and shows the developing relationship with the Princess and the farmboy/terrorist and his disturbed sister. The movie has multiple plot lines, and none them really pan out worth anything.   Part the problem may have been that watched the dub, which was quite bad. The entire cast mumbled all their lines was hard follow what was going on. But got the general idea. (Knowing exactly what was said would not have saved the movie eyes)  If you've heard about this being futuristic action/ninja flick, then you've heard wrong. Thats what thought was when heard about it, and now I've lost minutes life. Don't let this happen you. Steer well clear it.,\n can't say that this film deserves anywhere near the amount vitriol being heaped some reviewers. Yes, it's bogged down overly-padded running time, hamfisted editing, and overreliance cheeseball special effects. And lacks much the energy comedy needs get your average audience member sit through without checking his her watch.   On the other hand, it's also got some laugh-out-loud funny lines, talented and earnest cast, and the classic underdog premise. Macy, Stiller, and Azaria are brilliant the \"core\" team, and Garofalo and Studi superb work adding conflict and variety the team. can't say Reubens Mitchell added much the film overall, though each had few chances shine.   The plot, said above, your classic \"underdog-makes-good\" stuff. surprises there, since you know they're going triumph. What makes worthwhile not the absurd, gaudy heroes and villains, but the dialogue and interplay between the characters. Underneath all, these people are children heart, who just want right. The best scenes the film give this film its emotional grounding. Look Azaria's relationship with his long-suffering mother; Macy's endearing innocence his unwillingness accept Cap. Amazing's secret identity; Stiller's rage (not unlike that one weird, spazzy kid you once knew who'd always into quivering, impotent rages the playground); Garofalo's desire avenge her father. This childlike belief that sense justice and goodness will always make the world better place, the true appeal super-hero comics; and underneath its parodic exterior, \"Mystery Men\" shows why these hackneyed comic-book tropes matter many.  It never really gels into satisfying whole, due the huge number half-baked subplots (romance, family life, conflicts within the team, etc.), but the main plot such loopy fun that makes for that. The fact that it's supposed good, nonsensical fun seems lost some the reviewers here, I'll issue caveat: you're the type viewer who finds his enjoyment Itchy and Scratchy cartoon ruined the unexplained and illogical (\"Am believe this some sort of.. *snort*... _magic_ xylophone?\"), then you are far too literal-minded and humorless for this film. rent Sandler film instead.  (7/10),\n This without doubt the funniest the Curly stooges shorts. I've seen dozens times and always makes laugh. Hilarious pantomime sequences. perfect example \"musical comedy\". Even people who don't like the knuckleheads remember this one fondly.,\n wife and have watched this movie twice. Both used the Military. Besides being funny hell, offers very realistic view life the Navy from the perspective Navy enlisted man, and tells \"like really is\". We're adding this movie our permanent collection,\n Probably encouraged admirers her much-better \"Orlando\", Potter here delivers vehicle for herself the worst way: she writes, directs, stars, and actually co-writes the music, including mawkish love song. The film strongly resembles high school college project teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are fascinating her. But Potter's character unsympathetic the object her romantic obsession unlikable, and the whole film embarrassing display narcissism masquerading celebration the tango. Perhaps she hadn't cast herself might have worked. She just can't act, whether playing herself not. Pretentious, over-ambitious, dull, and silly.,\n \"Xizao\", the tale about the clash modern life and ancient traditions, and its effects family China. Ming (Quanxiu Pu), businessman who returns home when letter sent his brother Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe that his father Liu (Xu Zhu), has died. founds that his father still alive, well his old neighborhood and his father old business, the public bathroom.  The movie centers around Ming's family, and how has learn the importance his father's job, something always had considered old tradition that had die soon. Also, the movie explores his relationship with Ming, who mentally challenged, and the problems the small community and how the bathroom place that purifies not only their bodies, but also their souls.  The two main themes the movie, the family and the problems progress, are incredibly well handled, and the movie never loses the point trying make, both themes are very good developed and get glimpse Chinese society and customs.  The director, Yang Zhang, tells his tale simple way, letting the characters characters the job. very simple approach, but fits the movie perfectly, and highly doubt that another style would fit the movie this good. Zhang has enormous potential, can tell story without the aid visual flare camera tricks.  The acting outstanding its naturalistic approach, everyone acts very natural way and almost looks they were real persons being filmed. The three lead characters give remarkable performances, and Jiang Ming surely steals the show.  Even when the movie could had sticked patronizing \"old days were much better\" message, instead takes attitude equilibrium, like saying that progress good, and must move on, but must not forget where came from, and keep equilibrium between modern life and the traditions old.  An awesome, and touching film. 8/10,\n This another typical unbelievable and non-sensical piece Hollywood dreck.  Kurt Russell, Snake Pliskin business suit, convinces was better 2nd baseman. Ray Liotta the psychotic cop totally predictable and absurd. Madeline Stowe her usual cardboard self, and does little convincing victim.  Every scene this persiflage absolutely predictable all the way the end when Kurt clouts Ray with vase something, knocking him down and out. Kurt and Madeline then their obligatory end-of-the-movie embrace, and EVERYBODY--- except Russell and Stowe, KNOWS Liotta going get back and menace the couple again.  He does, course, and Russell drills him times with his 9mm, which was ENTIRELY unnecessary. This movie could just well ended with the bludgeoning scene--- EXCEPT Hollywood dotes unnecessary violence, and the more they can add, \"enhance\", the more slobbery they get.,\n just loved watching though and having fun with it's total badness film. saw this film through the helpful sarcasm Mystery Science Theater 3000 and have the DVD. you flip the the other side the DVD, they show the actual movie, gave chance. Seriously, folks this grilled cheese.  The acting, special effects, and plot general very cheesy and unrealistic. \"Doesn't she need lungs\" said Crow noticing how the head can still talk while doesn't have body, and Tom Servo just wistfully remarks \"No, she's got neck juice!\". The ending just classic and one can touch this soundtrack with K-Porn! loved the \"cat fight\" between the two strippers. That \"Meow\" after the fight scene, whatever, was classic. So, some ways this was fun movie. think for horror fans, you'll probably enjoy it. For good time, watch the MSTK3 version, you'll get great laugh.  MST3K version: 10/10 The Brain that would die: 1/10,\n The more watch Nicholas Cage, the more appreciate him actor. Watching this movie now (in 2005), can see that doesn't really fit into the genre movies that was coming out the early 90s. don't really think can considered film noir, but pretty dark times, due mostly the lighting and odd personalities the characters.  Typical performances from each the three main actors, who all did good job with their roles. thought, however, that Hopper and Boyle's characters were left undeveloped, was sometimes hard understand what they were doing and why they were doing it. Hopper love him hate him kind guy. The plot really good, and although found some parts very unrealistic, there were parts where had hand the director (i.e. when first sees the sheriff). All all, this movie definitely worth watching. ***1/2,\n This candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience lifetime. Cool title, excellent director saw \"To Die For\" and \"Drugstore Cowboy\" before this), and hey Uma Thurman the cast. How can you wrong? Well, that question that throbbed temples for hours after watched this turkey.  Disjointed and unfunny attempt offbeat, this dead-zone movie that should avoided all costs. Its critical lambasting was well deserved. You have here one those rare films that does not contain single redeeming quality. Zero out ****.,\n wasn't terribly impressed with Dante's 1st season offering \"Homecoming\", wasn't much horror story, but rather smart political statement with the undead. Screwfly situation the story virus unleashed the world that causes men's sexual drive replaced with murderous tendencies toward women. The episode starts out all right with short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed scientists. Then there short scene where man arrested when females bodies are discovered his home. assume this supposed show the beginning the outbreak, but unclear because this never revisited. The episode ons for while introducing characters blah blah blah.It seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars get worse and worse lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end. The worst episode. Well, except for chocolate.,\n This movie awed much that watch least once year. times find uncomfortable. times find empowering. And always find the characters human and real. movie that shows you the gritty reality life LA, starting with the recurring helicopter search lights scanning for the dangers lurking close the ordinary lives being carried the characters. also movie that shows you how the kindness stranger can change your life and empower you make difference. Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take, whether intended not, has powerful repercussions. found this movie similar many ways Robert Altman's film Short Cuts. Both had star-studded roster perfectly cast actors actresses and both movies allowed you gradually see how the the characters interrelated with one another and affected each other, for better worse. Grand Canyon did better job providing cohesive message, (hope the face despairing reality), than Altman's film, although found them both intriguing their own way. This film definite must see!!!,\n Jason Lee does his best bring fun silly situation, but the movie just fails make connect.   Perhaps because Julia Stiles character seems awkward the conniving and sexy soon cousin-in-law.   Maybe because she and Selma Blair's characters should have been cast the opposite way. (Selma Blair seems more conniving than Julia would be).  Either way this movie yet another Hollywood trivialization possibly real world situation (that being getting caught with your pants out your bachelor party not stooping your cousin), which while having promise fails deliver.  There are some laughs sure and the cast (even miscast) their best with sub grade material which doesn't transcend its raunchy topic. instead getting successful raunch fest (ie Animal House American Pie) are left with middle ground part humor and part stupidity (ala Meatballs something).,\n Turned out classy production with what must have been low budget. The variety characters amazing, from axe-wielding dwarfs 7ft ghouls! enjoyed the relationship between the leads, not overly sentimental but romantic enough keep the interest going. also enjoyed the mix humour (which can very easy get wrong, too much/not enough) which meant didn't get too dark, nor too spoofy. was great step from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, terms storyline and production. They have great website which worth checking out. Can't wait for Bane, the level improvement continues, should fantastic.,\n can't come with appropriate enough words describe the horror felt sitting that cinema watching Ramgopal Varma Aag, the director's half-hearted attempt pay tribute that classic Bollywood western, Sholay. The biggest problem with Varma's remake that doesn't even try make credible film. It's evident every single frame this movie that Varma's heart just not it. What you see screen bad joke best, gimmick the part the filmmaker, and pains you see what little regard actually shows for film claims he's been fan all his life.I've seen several bad films over the years, but can't remember one that's been much torture sit through this one. Consider yourself very brave you're able survive the entire film, because tests your patience like few films have before.Varma may borrow his plot and characters from the original film, but his version trite and hollow and doesn't have any the spirit and energy Sholay. Ramgopal Varma Aag actually mockery that timeless gem because turns out everything that the original film was not way-over-the-top, too-long-too-boring, and entirely mindless. Much-loved moments from Sholay are parodied Varma and for that you want wring his neck. One the most memorable scenes Sholay which Dharmendra Veeru climbs the watertank and threatens jump down his death turned around this film with Ajay Devgan playing Hero, pulling pistol his head threatening shoot himself. How you wish he'd pulled the trigger and spared all the agony.Not only does Ramgopal Varma Aag fail remake Sholay, it's pretty bad effort even stand-alone film. The eardrum-damaging background score sounds more like someone clanging vessels the kitchen, and the camera-work alternates between dramatic and head-spinning. Partners this terrible crime bringing this ridiculous film screen are the film's mostly dead-as-wood actors. Sushmita Sen Devi the widow takes both her role and the film too seriously, punctuating her lines with pauses, staring into camera for effect, and generally performing like her life depends upon it. Mohanlal Narsimha, struggles with his Hindi dialogue and looks embarrassed delivering some the stupidest lines his illustrious career. Newcomer Prashant Raj playing Jai-equivalent Raj has acting chops speak and can't strum any the brooding intensity Amitabh Bachchan brought the part the original film.As Hero, the new-age Veeru, Ajay Devgan entirely hopeless, failing miserably his attempts comedy. But the film's weakest link, easily the most shocking casting decision Nisha Kothari Ghunghroo, who steps into the shoes Hema Malini Basanti, the endearing airhead from Sholay. Nisha Kothari not only the worst actress this country, but possibly the worst actress this whole wide world, she gives the word annoying whole new meaning, and she makes you want slit your wrists every time she's screen. And then, there Amitabh Bachchan playing Babban Singh, Ramgopal Varma's version Hindi cinema's most popular villain Gabbar Singh. The only actor this ensemble who recognises the film's over-the-top tone and plays along accordingly, Bachchan constructs menacing character who treat watch. He's meant comic book villain who snarls and sneers and hisses and hams, and does all that good effect. But because he's trapped such doomed enterprise, his performance doesn't really help elevate the film any way.No surprises here, I'm going with zero out ten and two thumbs down for Ramgopal Varma Aag, one's those painful movie-watching experiences you wouldn't subject even enemy to. It's not like Varma hasn't handled remake before. With Sarkar gave smart, gripping take The Godfather, and it's pity he's made this Sholay bhature out such much-loved classic. Ramgopal Varma Aag his worst career decision ever, it's also dark spot his resume he'll embarrassed forever. suspect this film will down movie history Ramgopal Varma Daag.,\n Water Lilies well-made first film from France about young female sexuality and friendship. Sciamma works with specialized, slightly sanitized material that off-putting some alluring others. The film focuses exclusively three middle-class teenage girls tidy new Paris suburb. Their lives revolve around big indoor swimming pool where two the three are part synchronized water ballet team.  Such distractions parents, siblings, work and school have been neatly excised from the equation. The central sensibility belongs the attractively sullen but skinny Marie (Pauline Acquart), who not the team, but thinks she would like be. Marie worships Floriane (Adèle Haenel), alluring blonde and team standout whom the boys are after. This takes Marie away from her former best friend, also member the water ballet team, the somewhat plump Anne (Louise Blachère). Being less special Anne more truly accessible the boys. Floriane, like this film, promises bit more then she truly offers. Marie has the more essential quality for teenage girl: she suffers inwardly. Flroiane doesn't much suffer jump into situations and then bolt.  Marie dazzled the glamor the water ballet well Floriane. Floriane takes advantage this make Marie first her slave and cover for her assignations, then, lacking any other friends, her confidante. All the other girls think Floriane slut, illusion she encourages the men and boys she teases, because leads them on. She suffers the pretty girl's fate being not person but object, and she can't resist the validation the boys give her wanting kiss her and bed her, but she doesn't really care about any them and knows her involvements with them are trap. Enlisting Marie act her pal her (unseen) mother won't know she's going out meet boys, she also gets Marie rescue her from the boys later. looked the opposite first, but Floriane needs Marie much Marie thinks she needs her. Anne left with her discomfort with her body and desire get laid that's earthier and more real than the other girls'.  Keeping all external context bay, Sciamma can highlight subtle shifts the delicate equation the three girls' goals and interactions. the other hand the film's water madness, which includes lots showering and spitting well underwater swimming shots, makes feel completely airless times and some its minutes not pass quickly. Luckily the film has sense humor and lets the trio sometimes forget their ever-present goals and avoidances and just silly, pointless girl things. It's the offbeat moments that give the film life; too bad way that there aren't more them. But Sciamma has the courage her obsessions and what remains one walks out the theater the personalities and their dynamics. Along the way course pleasant watch the swimming and gaze the girls, who understandably love gaze themselves.   There's great revelation drama the way, but things get bit more interesting when emerges that Marie doesn't just admire but truly desires Floriane and jealous her boyfriends--whom Floriane always stops before they all the way. typical irony this kind plot, Floriane actually decides she wants have her first real sex with Marie--but Marie the one who holds off, because she knows won't have the significance Floriane that will have her. When happens, it's timid, mechanical affair. Meanwhile Anne has huge crush Francois (Warren Jacquin), male swimmer, but course after Floriane. Boys are not element that's been subtracted and there always seem several dozen ready poolside the dance floor, but they are just bodies and faces, available studs.,\n The Invisible Maniac starts young Kevin Dornwinkle (Kris Russell) caught his strict mother (Marilyn Adams) watching girl (Tracy Walker) strip through his telescope... Cut 'Twenty Years Later' Kevin Dornwinkle (Noel Peters) now physics professor who claims have discovered way turn things invisible using 'mollecular reconstruction' serum.

Co-written directed Adam Rifkin wisely hiding under the pseudonym Rif Coogan wouldn't want name associated with this turd film either) The Invisible Maniac real bottom the barrel stuff. The script Rifkin, sorry Coogan Tony Markes awful. tries teenage sex/comedy/horror hybrid that just fails every department. For start the sex nothing more than few female shower scenes few boob shots, not much else I'm afraid the birds The Invisible Maniac aren't even that good looking. The comedy lame every joke misses the proverbial mile, this the kind film that thinks someone fighting invisible man having Henry (Jason Logan) mute man trying make phone call funny. The Invisible Maniac makes the Police Academy (1984 1994) series films look like the pinnacle sophistication! for the horror aspect that too lame. It's also incredibly slow (it takes over half hour before Dornwinkles even becomes invisible), dull, predictable, boring has highly annoying unlikable teenage character's.  Director Rifkin Coogan whatever does absolutely nothing try make The Invisible Maniac even slightly enjoyable experience. There's scares, tension atmosphere whole the film real chore sit through. does nothing with the invisibility angle, just few doors opening their own adventurous gets. There very little gore violence, bit splashing blood, few strangulations the only decent bit the whole film when someone has their head blown off with shotgun, unfortunately was invisible the time only get see the headless torso afterwards.  The budget must have been low, mean really low because this one seriously cheap looking film. Dornwinkles laboratory basically two jars his bedside cabinet! When escapes from the mental institution has all one dog sent after him the entire school has about dozen pupils two teachers. The Invisible Maniac poorly made film throughout it's minute duration, spotted the boom mike least one occasion... Lets just say the acting low standard leave that.  The Invisible Maniac crap, plain simple. found redeeming features all, there are many more better films out there you can watch there reason whatsoever waste your time this rubbish. Definitely one avoid.,\n gave this out points. love much. child the 80s and totally into heavy metal for many years. Those are the reasons like this movie much. Its cool see those posters the bedroom that boy (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted sister...)and his vinyl collection(unveiling the wicked Exciter, Rise the mutants shock metal master Impaler and Killing business Megadeth). Also the soundtrack FASTWAY totally incredible and fits very well with the plot. you are into metal, then TRICK TREAT your friend. Don't buy watch this movie for OZZY GENE SIMMONS because they are the movie for seconds, watch because the soundtrack and the story that will take you back the glory 80s. You will not the same person after.,\n failure. The movie was just not good. has humor that year olds that will not even giggle at. mean, sure, some parts were amusing, but most not. Lindsey Lohan great actress (and bad singer,) and she should working better movies. The movie should have been aired Disney Channel original movie, that FREE.  The only thing that was well done about this movie was the music. Nothing like remade rock soundtrack brighten your day. These songs are good. Especially Alyson and Amanda's Walking Sunshine and Caleigh Peter's, Beach Boy song, Fun Fun Fun.  4 out 10. gave ten, that would the music and will the movie. Not worth your money, but the soundtrack is.,\n How amazing this film is! I've seen over and over throughout the years and I'm always spellbound it. The reason why the film easy re-watch is, course, the arresting performance given the young Bette Davis. She not only steals every scene that she's in, but actually much prettier and better photographed here (not mention sexier) than she was any the films that she had made thus far her home studio, Warner Brothers (this film was made R.K.O. Radio Pictures). She wears very flattering make-up and has very attractive hairstyles and oh, those lovely big eyes (especially, the restaurant scenes that take place London's Soho). Her body was curvy when she was young. Get load the cheap negligee that she wears for her big explosive confrontation scene with Leslie Howard. And boy, she absolute powerhouse that scene. Howard little too nervous throughout, but does captures the hero's sensitivity. Frances Dee scores the sweet, pretty young Sally who truly loves him. Max Steiner's score both charming and poignant. Splendid performances and thirties flavor make this the must see version the classic novel.,\n Alas, poor Hamlet. knew him, dear reader, and let tell thee, THIS VERSION SUCKS! don't know who all people put the money for this flotsam, but hope that they're proud themselves. They took THE classic play and turned into the most boring melodrama imaginable. This version quite literally bad, that not even the presence great thespian like Maximilian Schell the title role can save it. This movie's only redeeming quality that made great fodder for \"MST3K\"; Mike, Servo and Crow had lot fun with this one.  But either way, I'm sure that Shakespeare, had been alive when they made this, would not have wanted his name associated with it. This \"Hamlet\" not even bad that's good; it's just plain bad. Absolutely dreadful.,\n watched this film recently DVD and have say wasn't impressed. know it's taboo knock independent films, but this one felt devoid entertainment.  The premise was interesting, but the execution fell short. found myself thinking \"okay, they're just getting into it, the story will pick soon\". Before knew it, the film was over and the story never picked up. can't say found the acting all that impressive either. was pretty bad. Not Star Wars prequel trilogy bad, but bad nonetheless.  I'm not sure what the running time was, I'll assume two hours (because it's safe estimate). Anyway, when the film was finished, felt though deserved some kind recognition for the will power exerted not stopping the film and walking away halfway through.  Again, was thoroughly unimpressed, and eventually bored out wits. I'm not one those guys who requires fast-paced action and explosions film, don't start that being reason for not liking it.,\n After all, you not Orson Welles movie see nice simple little plot and burnishing the image happy-ever-after star   You see theatrically heightened characters locked conflict against colorful and unusual settings, lighted and scored imaginatively, photographed bravely, and the whole thing peppered with unexpected details surprise that wiser and duller director would either avoid not think the first place   As usual, well directing, Welles wrote the script and also played the hero young Irish seaman who had knocked about the world and seen its evil, but still retained his clear-eyed trust the goodness others Unfortunately for him, reposed this trust Rita Hayworth, whose cool good looks concealed gloomy past and murderous inclinations for the future She was married without love, impotent, crippled advocate, acted like malevolent lizard the brilliant Everett Sloane   There youthful romanticism underlying all, and this quality came into exuberant play \"The Lady from Shanghai.\" Before the inevitable happened, Welles escaped final triangular showdown hall mirrors, which has become one the classic scenes the post-war cinema   Welles did not miss chance throughout the whole film counterpoint the words and actions with visual detail which enriched the texture and heightened the atmosphere His camera seemed almost caress Rita Hayworth the sun played with her hair and her long limbs while she playfully teased the young seaman into her web,\n really not know what people have against this film, but it's definitely one favourites. It's not preachy, it's not anchored it's moral, shouldn't controversial. It's just God. Any possible God, matter the religion. And it's really funny.  Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan, reporter usually stuck the lighter side the news, desperate prove himself (more less himself) that can taken seriously and good job anchor job. This drive what slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) away. When the final straws are executed, he's quick not laugh, but yell the face God, who turn gives Bruce his powers. Bruce then makes his life better for himself, until he's guilted into helping others, where then continues miss the point his powers. Meanwhile, his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish, leaving his relationship dangerous ground.  OK, that was kinda long. But plot, works well. The step-by-step fashion which meet the challenges being God much better than clustering his problems together, and able hide itself fairly well.  As you probably know from hearing about this movie the first place, Carrey's pitch-perfect acting stays character (which, luckily enough, him), and controls and gives atmosphere the movie scene scene. Whether they would admit not, the role was written rewritten exclusively for Carrey. Without him, the humour would turn flat, humour half execution. And the humour very good the first place. But without Carrey, would kinda feel like It's Wonderful Life wannabe.  Jennifer Aniston great and, matter what some may say, does not act like the only excuse for the third act. least, you don't think that when you see her. She gives heartfelt performance and makes you forget you're watching movie, she and Carrey feel very much like real couple.  The movie feels ggooooodd (see the movie understand), has very nice feeling, tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just save Carrey's career (which wasn't goin' anywhere.).,\n Another review likened this troupe cross between Monty Python and Twin Peaks, also aptly. Yet another review expounded the differences between the comedy enjoy non-critically and black comedy, also well worth consideration.  Watch the whole thing, all three series. the end, all the characters are tied and the puzzle pieces fall into place just well Douglas Adams novel. The detail and intricacies are staggering. Thoroughly post-modern. Wickedly funny, and startlingly tragic. Not for kids. Not for those with thin skins who lack objectivity. Thought-provoking. once literal, figurative, and surreal disturbing ways. The blackest comedy can recall.  And very possibly the most wonderful thing will ever see.,\n Images are great and reflect well the landscapes Canada. The story was, the other side, quite boring; eyes was love story the woods just like Titanic was love story boat. did not feel that Grey Owl was great environmentalist. usually like Lord Attenborough but this one was ... bad.,\n movie about ancient Egyptian curse brought the the 20's during the filming DeMille's first version the Commandments and which reawakened when DeMille's sets are unearthed the desert.  One the worst films I've seen long time.  The question were the filmmakers serious kidding when they made this film? this serious its laughably bad movie and great film pick for its badness. its comedy its less good but funny for all the wrong reasons.You will laugh long and hard this film, probably more than many other Hollywood \"comedies\".,\n This excellent series. You will laugh, you will cry, these wonderful people will part your family. The way this family cares for one another and helps each other through their crisis sets great example the way should live our lives. There are many good things they do, and number bad choices, but they never turn their backs family, they work through problems. Michelle, the youngest daughter, the cutest thing I've seen. Stephanie, the middle daughter, suffers with Middle Child Syndrome and with the help EVERYONE the family it's better. DJ, the oldest daughter, growing whether her dad wants happen not. One thing they all share they miss their mom. Danny (Dad), Joey, and Uncle Jesse love these kids much, and it's apparent every episode.,\n This game was made Sega. Being made Sega didn't expect much, but also didn't expect this junk either. For starters the camera angles work against you this game. The motorcycle your means getting around. The motorcycle the worst part the game. Whenever you run something you just stick there and you don't move. You never fall off the bike wreck for that matter. The main character hardly talks even though he's got voice that suits him. The graphics are horrible. You ride through trees your bike. The camera makes fighting the enemy impossible. This game wouldn't even worth renting.,\n Before comment about this movie, you should realize that when saw this movie, expected the typical crap, horror, B-movie and just wanted have fun. Jack Frost one that not only delivers but actually one the best that I've seen long time. Scott McDonald great Jack Frost, fact think has future being psychopaths big time movies ever given the chance. McDonald serial killer who becomes snowman through some stupid accidental mix ridiculous elements. soon that snowman starts moving around and killing people, though, you will find hard not laugh. The lines that are said are completely retarded but really funny. The fact that the rest the cast completely over-acts just adds stupidity the film, but it's stupidity it's genius. The scene where the snowman with the teenage girl truly classic B-movie, horror film fashion. truly hope there sequel and I'll right there watch whatever cable channel does it. course it's only fun watch the first few times and it's not exactly good work motion picture technology, but just like see snowmen kill people. gave out 10, this great movie for dates and couples the late hours.,\n George Lopez funny man even without the sitcom. The first episodes saw this too often made jokes the expense his mom. have watched this more, there has been more more variety. one the cast really safe from his wit now.  It seems this season has progressed that George getting more comfortable with the family sitcom Dad role. first wasn't, but getting More more into groove. This makes both him the shows progressively funnier. They had added couple characters for George play off this year too. His wife's dad getting more more involved the plot.  His mom still there, but not central past seasons. think prudent say with George's sense comic timing, ABC's lack good sitcoms, George Lopez has good chance being here ABC long after George Bush.,\n Joel schumacher Made heck choice when decided this cast and this script. The story well written and well laid out, and this entirely new cast central characters was absolutely brilliant. seemed that there were \"leads\" and about half dozen supporting, and far this the best thing about the movie, the fresh young faces tomorrow. has been long time since hollywood has touched the controversial vietnam war films,which says something for the\"story that needed told\"(as stated schumacher) and Tigerland lands that handful top war movies period. Yet can not labeled war movie because seemed based more the human spirit Bozz and the others. Think anyone who just wants see good film with out all the special FX, but just good, gritty drama should see Tigerland, obviously Shumachers Best works the past years.,\n It's not terrible movie, really, and Glenn and Keitel are top-notch actors. Further, they acceptable job with the very weak script. The scenery lush and the plot has some interesting twists. Further, umderstand why these actors and the crew made the film, they are professionals and they get paid for it. But wonder why studios spend the time and money make film and then don't release for theater audiences? Even film box-office flop, surely makes some money. you are fan Keitel Glenn, rent the video catch TV, did Granted, the movie won't help solve the immigration quandary with Mexico, but the experience far better than 90% the standard fare today.,\n The word \"1st\" the title has more ominous meaning for the viewers this film than for its crime victims. least they don't have stick around and watch this interminable film reach its own demise.  1st should refer to: 1st draft script; 1st takes used each performance the final film; 1st edit post production; etcetera, etcetera.  The movie not cast too badly, it's just that everything about the film come off worse than third rate, from the goofy script, the wooden performances. And while suffering through this cobbled together film, the hour mark you want put out your misery. 160 minutes long readily apparent that should have been edited under hours.  Going into details concerning the lame script and acting serves little purposes. Even the equally awful, Lake Placid, least the performances Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda constructed out extremely weak script, were nuanced enough make you laugh the movie. 1st Die, one ends grieving only for the time lost waiting see what happens after the opening scene the preparation the female lead's suicide.  The editing bad one never introduced one the main characters, who think (were never quite told) D.A. She just appears one scene the middle conversation. Obviously the scene where she introduced the viewer was dropped the editor's floor. And one realized that character appearing out nowhere was unusual film ploy.  In word, don't waste your time with this one. wife and wish didn't. But least created our own diversions commenting various places the film like was Mystery Science Theater. \"Meanwhile, Cleveland !!!!,\n saw this film for the first time not too long TCM's \"Essentials\" series. The eye the beholder cliché was never more apropos. This beholder saw little value this one. was puzzled the infinite attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed. Granted, Ms. Bacall was beautiful woman, but this film her character comes off more mousy than attractive. would think men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would more likely ignore Lucy than fall into instant infatuation with her. Bacall's defense, this film was made the time Humphrey Bogart's last illness and the weight his deteriorating health may have affected her performance. course part this mousiness the part Lucy was contrast her slutty Marylee, played the hilt and beyond Dorothy Malone. The scene where she engages wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs fatal heart attack far and away the best scene the film. Malone's performance outshines the rest, although Jasper Hadley's weariness the disappointing behavior his two children brilliantly portrayed Robert Keith. Generally, though, would have say that I'm just not much fan melodrama. The cartoonish behavior the characters just makes for story too implausible for tastes.,\n \"The Golden Child\" was Eddie Murphy's first film since his megahit \"Beverly Hills Cop\". And even though it's not good \"Cop\", it's fun comic adventure. Murphy stars finder lost children who's assigned most unusual case. His assignment: find the title character, child with mystical powers. This movie could have been titled \"Beverly Hills Cop and the Temple Doom\" since parts this movie plays like Spielbergian adventure, kinda like Indiana Jones comedy. It's got comedy with laughs, and adventure with special effects. Lots fun.  *** (out four),\n passed this one the shelf few times, looking the myriad huge positive quotes (with tiny names) the front and wondering was missing something. The other night was one the movie channels, and tuned in. missed nothing.  I must admit that only watched the first minutes. Perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that. Given the slow, plodding pace and complete lack laughter the first 30, seriously doubt it.  The lead character starts the movie classic don't know how start movie\" style, with long, tiresome monologue about how doesn't want get sued. It's not funny. It's not even remotely funny. Others have commented the \"San Franclisco\" bit; ok, small chuckle the first time says it. Then grinds into the ground, smiling the camera like it's the funniest thing ever written. Get over yourself. fact, think the talking the camera bit was the reason instantly disliked the film. Don't assume familiarity with your audience. Familiarity _earned_, much like respect.  From there you basically have fat whiny guy talking very effeminate way about his dull life temp. didn't realize he's Jewish; it's discredit Jewish comedians call this \"Jewish humor\". It's just unfunny humor. Just because you're Jewish doesn't mean you have knack for the comedy. WASP, Spalding Gray, does better job self-analytical humor than this guy, obviously it's not about ethnicity.  If one the bits had seen had worked, might have stuck around. But some schlub going about how much loves the names the women works with, then listing them for five long minutes, doesn't make great movie.  This obvious attempt capitalize the popularity \"Office Space\". Don't let yourself become victim target marketing. Just say \"Haiku Tunnel\".,\n opinion, October Sky one the best movies 1999...It totally has everything emotional drama movie would need, like, wonderful story and good character interactions. October Sky will remain heart for long can remember, and just have say very special thanks those who have created this film.,\n great film requiring acquired taste. you're into action, wham bam films and hate serious love stories then its not for you. Otherwise, you like sit front good intelligent movie now and again recommend this very highly. Easily the best film produced Bollywood this century.  The only other Indian film would give 10/10 for Dil Wale Dulhaniya Jayenge. Even then comes second this masterpiece.,\n Every now and then movie advertises itself scary frightening, though they usually aren't. Most modern horror movies fit into this category.  Then there are those movies that don't simply cause the tension and adrenaline pump through your veins harder than usual. They actually frighten you level that you've never experienced.  \"Halloween\" such film. takes many risks that would make most movie producers cringe. But nearly all them work. \"Halloween\" awe-inspiring its simplicity, and terrifying whole.  The story simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) babysitting some kids Halloween night, while madman the loose after escaping from mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister years ago. course, the madman, later known Michael Myers, begins killing the local teenage population, and eventually comes after Laurie.  Sounds familiar, right? Just another brainless slasher filled with dumb teenagers and gobs gore. Not chance.  I think James Berardinelli puts perfectly his review \"Halloween:\" \"Because its title, Halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late-1970s and early-1980s. However, while Halloween rightfully considered the father the modern slasher genre, not member...\"   He has point, and for number reasons. First and foremost, it's downright terrifying, whereas most entries into the teen slasher genre are dumb gore-fests (one could argue that many recent ones are tongue-in-cheek, but most those fail well). Second, there almost violence (very little which bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary, and relies very little (actually, the body count pretty low). fact, one can argue that this isn't really horror movie, least not todays standards having the most deaths that can crammed into single movie, each gorier and more sadistic than the last. relies ideas for scares, and also skill. Third, while some the characters may stupid things (that sometimes seal their fate), they don't them because they're dumb. The characters are real people, instead thinking that the characters die because they're idiots, we're frightened because they're making mistake.  One the main reasons why \"Halloween\" scary because easy believe that it's real. Nothing hard swallow this film. There's supernatural, there's ridiculously creative plot elements, \"inventive\" murders, whatnot. Instead, all the set pieces and camera work (save the opening sequence) are simple. Carpenter just sets the camera place and says action. What get the feeling that we're actually seeing murder take place right front us.  Horror movies are probably the most difficult films make because order for something scary, everything has perfect, and ideas never work twice. It's hit miss game, which why were tell you all the good ideas that Carpenter has (which I'm not), they'd seem primitive (particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the years).  Acting here not plus point because doesn't need be. This movie about scary ideas, not movie about dramatic, conflicted characters. The actors act like real people, not characters from story. Nothing more. The exception this whoever plays The Shape, later known Michael Myers. can scary have person say nothing and simply kill, but it's hard pull off (and even harder keep people from asking why). But the guy pulls off, and the result terrifying.  This Carpenter's movie through and through. directed it, co-wrote it, co-produced it, and wrote the chilling score it. This man brilliance, and his later movie \"The Thing\" supports this statement, though The Thing not scary \"Halloween.\" Unfortunately his success has dramatically diminished, happens when the lure big money for less freedom taken advantage once big time producers \"recognize your potential.\" good this film is, it's not without flaws. The famous opening scene disturbing, but not very scary. And not many the scares work for the first part the movie. It's not that it's bad, it's just that there's good reason fear \"The Shape.\" Luckily, Carpenter mostly uses this time set relationship between the characters and the audience. While there's intimacy this relationship, fits the purpose. grow know the characters, but not much that it's disheartening when they die. But once the film gets Halloween night, that's when Carpenter kicks things into high gear and NEVER stops until you get the end.  While \"Halloween\" may flawed, only slightly so. immensely terrifying film, and must see for anyone who loves scary movies. warned though, this movie will scare the living hell out you!,\n Fred Gwynne, Lewis, Sid Caesar, and Yvonne Carlo star this funny, funny movie. The late Fred Gwynne truly wonderful Herman Munster who lives with Grandpa Munster (Al Lewis), wife Lily (Yvonne Carlo), and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar hilarious the owner wax museum that has whole section dedicated the Munster family. When the wax figures Herman and Grandpa begin terrorize the town everyone blames the two. The two now have clear their names before it's too late. You'll laugh out loud just like did.,\n What can say about Cruel intentions Well, can say all honesty, will only watch this film again fastened chair and have eyes opened clockwork-orange-style.  The film 'stars' Robin Dunne (No, never heard him either), whose awful impression Ryan Phillipe made cringe throughout. case terrible casting, Dunne attempts (and fails) carry off playing handsome charismatic, charmer. Since the actor not handsome, nor charismatic nor charming, the character left wholly unbelievable. Amy Adams, (she was episode buffy one time), tries pick where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off and bring scheming Katherine life... However, Adams not that good actress and her performance was flat and lacking any real emotion, often she looked like she was reading cue cards just off camera. There were two good actors the film however, Barry Flatman (Saw Saw and Mimi Rogers (Mrs Kensington Austion Powers), made very good and entertaining performances the parents Sebastian and Katherine and are the only reason why rated the film not 1.  The film itself poor version the original, with such lows carbon copy's dialogue and mimicked scenes which lacked the originality the previous film.  I think that show, might have worked, but had been recasted with people who could actually act the main parts.,\n CitizenX(1995) the developing world's answer Silence the Lambs. Where `Silence' terrorized our peace mind, `Citizen' exhausts and saddens instead. This dramatization the Chikatilo case translates rather well, thanks Westernized friendship between two Rostov cops who become equals.  CitizenX may also argue against(!) the death penalty far better than Kevin Spacey's The Life David Gayle(2002).  Humans are Machiavellian mammals, under which lie limbic brains (lizard-logic). Why did two kids, who knew better, stone death toddler they kidnapped? Why bloodthirsty women yell `li-lilililililii' acts OBSCENE terrorism? -My own term for this `limbic domination', the lizard-logic urge dominate `enemy'. you have the words `enemy'/`vengeance' your vocabulary, you're easily capable `limbic domination'.  In WWII-devastated 1980s Rostov (located the mouth the Don river near the Black Sea), nothing suppressed Andrei Chikatilo's urge for `limbic domination' from overpowering his layers civilization. Chikatilo(Jeffrey DeMunn)'s easy victims were paupers, usually children, who rode the interurban train for fun, since they couldn't afford anything else.  CitizenX reminds that the denials rampant Soviet bureaucracy cost the lives such `lambs'. Rostov's serial killer roamed free for almost years AFTER the police arrested and let him go.  The politicization crimefighting harmful police forces everywhere. Although policing routinely suffers from corruption all over the world, the west, vote-grabbing politicians can set chronic inter-agency rivalries, stymieing more coordinated response crime. the Soviet Union CitizenX, however, Viktor Burakov(Stephen Rea)'s Killer Department was suffering from repressive bureaucracy.  Geoffrey DeMunn plays the psychosexually inadequate Chikatilo with faultless but understated authority--to the point complete obscurity. real life, too, Chikatilo had lifetime's experience blending and evading capture.  His pursuer, the other hand, sticks out strange bird, given unheralded, naive outbursts. Perhaps design, Stephen Rea gives very strange performance forensics chief Burakov. Rea's Russian accent impenetrable; and his Burakov humourless and sullen, odds with everyone.  So it's Donald Sutherland who walks away with the picture. Sutherland's Col.Fetisov, Burakov's boss, and first his only supporter, overly restrained, patient Militiaman whose dignified carriage bears testimony decades bureaucratic machinations. His reawakening logic-driven yet still passionate cop becomes the film's cornerstone idealism.  Joss Ackland does another turn vicious apparatchik, Secretary Communist Ideology Bondarchuk, overseeing the investigation. Naturally, quashed the arrest the most likely suspect, Communist, 1984, man carrying rope and knife his bag, supposedly going home: Andrei Chikatilo.  Soon, replaced Burakov with another Moscow apparatchik, Detective Gorbunov(John Wood), insisting that the investigation now focus `known homosexuals'. The funniest scene this sad, sad film comes during Bondarchuk's Gorbunov's institutionalized harassment: one stupid cop earnestly reports, `As suspected, comrade, it's fornication. I've made some drawings'--cue howling laughter.  5yrs after the bodies began piling up, 1987, the police finally tried soliciting criminal profiles. The only cooperating Soviet psychiatrist was Aleksandr Bukhanovsky(Max Von Sydow), who termed the UNSUB `CitizenX'. later also observed Fetisov Burakov that `...together you make wonderful person'. concur.  The drawn-out pace, spread over decade, perfectly captures the institutional inertia Glasnost--`openness'--that wasn't. The contrast with Perestroika--`restructuring'--couldn't've been greater for the case. Although Chikatilo was still prowling railway stations, police plans were about bear fruit.  In 1990, Col.Fetisov was expeditiously promoted General. His nemesis Bondarchuk disappeared off the scene, allowing the investigation finally proceed without political interference. Staff, communications, publicity--suddenly all were available. just one night telephoning around, Fetisov got his depressed forensics chief access the FBI's Serial Murder Task Force Quantico, where, Fetisov discovered, staff are regularly rotated off serial murder cases stave off just such psychological damage investigators.  Fetisov advises his newly promoted forensics chief, now `Colonel' Burakov, all these changes avalanche confession that becomes the movie's powerhouse watershed scene. Fetisov's the most tender apology I've ever seen film: `Privately, offer deepest apologies you and your wife. hope that someday you can forgive ignorance', almost whispers.  A HBO production, CitizenX film the highest caliber. Not only the exteriors look authentically bleak (shot exclusively the most run-down parts otherwise spectacular Budapest), but Randy Edelman's soaring soundtrack entirely overwhelming--and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality. Those who speak Hungarian will recognize the many Hungarian accents and credits.  Chikatilo's actual murders are depicted bleak, aberrant behaviour born character flaws and ignorance equally bleak world. This makes the murders seem not-entirely-out-of-place--but course they were. President Kennedy reminded us, `we all cherish the futures our children'.  CitizenX communicates perfectly that killing far more grisly and obscene than any vengeance fantasy might imply. Serial rapists rape dominate; serial killers kill dominate. some soldiers. Such `limbic dominators' make poor humans.  WARNING-SPOILER:----------------------------------------------- The real Andrei Chikatilo WAS the world's most prolific known serial killer. Convicted, was executed 1992 the manner all Soviet Union death sentences: one shot, the back the head. Foolishly, such methods destroy any possibility studying deviant brain after death.  Conclusion:------------------------------------------------------------ The best outcome always the prevention killings, not their prosecution. Executions merely guarantee society's failure learn from the complex reality victims' deaths when dispatch even anecdotal evidence HOW/WHY they died. Nor killers learn regret they're dead.  Vengeance doesn't unkill victims. Baying for the killer's blood constitutes nothing better than counter-domination--once it's too late.  Vengeance behalf the grieving isn't justice for the deceased--it's appeasement the living.(10/10),\n This film's trailer interested enough warrant renting the DVD. However, the resulting movie absolutely dire! Admittedly, this not the worst film ever made, the worst film this year, but came damn close!  The main issue the film not knowing what wants be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? The story interesting, deals with the pitfalls mail-order brides, but the film mess. What starts out mildly interesting \"comedy\" word use the loosest possible terms), then goes totally reverse, and degenerates into very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin wasted! are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom can only presume did this for the money.  This bad film pretty much every single aspect. It's not funny, it's almost sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for everything did, and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty. film avoided, unless you absolutely have see Kidman Chaplin every one their films!,\n This film's basic premise political cartoon. suppose for those who know nothing about the realities the military this probably \"feel-good\" film gender equality.

Ring the bell, Demi! <br,\n Jochen Hick wrote and directed this little thriller suspense film based the concept that the AIDS virus was sheep virus mutated the government rid the world gays and was apparently tested convicts the years before the outbreak the hideous disease. Were not for the poignancy the concept the film, this would fall into the category the many films about the ruination the world rampant non-prejudicial infective organism.  Stefan (Tom Wlaschiha) journeys from Berlin San Francisco investigate his father's scientific suppositions about the induced sheep virus and its effects the convicts whom was infused. meets with some disdain and resistance dead theory, but also encounters some folks who know the theory and support his investigation. Simultaneously with his visit series serial murders takes place, each victim killed similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied strains music from Puccini's opera 'Turandot' which just happens opening the San Francisco Opera. police investigator Louise Tolliver (Irit Levi) and her companion cop (Kalene Parker) follow the murders while Stefan makes the rounds the sex clubs and bars San Francisco trying locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his father's theory. encounters strange lad Jeffrey (Jim Thalman) with whom has cat and mouse attraction and prominent Doctor Burroughs (Richard Conti) who seems oddly involved the cast suspects. How this all come end the play the film, story much about the search for self identity between Stefan and Jeffery case for investigation murders.  While Tom Wlaschiha, Jim Thalman and Richard Conti well with their roles (they are the only three who have any prior acting experience the film!), the quality the film sags considerably the less than acceptable minimally talented Irit Levy and Kaylene Parker: when screen the credibility the story drops below zero. There are some small cameos other actors that brighten the screen for the moments they inhabit, but all the film drowned the incessant replay 'Nessun dorma' sung Mario del Monaco from recording the opera and that seems the reason for making the film! Good idea for film and some good characterizations the actors, but there resolution the initial premise that started the whole thing. Grady Harp, February,\n TYSON   Aspect ratio: 1.33:1  Sound format: Stereo  Reverent though scrupulously fair account the life and times champion boxer Mike Tyson. Given his conviction rape charge, the film careful not portray him hero villain, but paints warts-and-all portrait his rise fame, the pressures success, and the people who shaped his destiny for good bad. Constrained time limits, the script gallops through succession relevant details, alighting briefly significant events, culminating with Tyson's (temporary) downfall 1995. Novices will enlightened the chronology, while boxing fans will entertained director Uli Edel's straight-arrow approach the material. portrays Tyson's life circus which was ultimately led astray the circumstances his own success. fact, the script reserves most its venom for Tyson's ex-wife Robin Givens, characterising her ungrateful gold-digger who took advantage his naivety. Production values are uniformly solid and the cast superb: Michael Jai White does fair imitation the title character; George Scott plays Tyson's mentor Cus D'Amato through acres gritted teeth; and Paul Winfield was surely born play Don King!,\n This has the absolute worst performance from Robert Duval who sounds just like William Buckley throughout the entire film. His hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest. I'm not sure this was deliberate scene stealing inadvertent but it's the only thing can recall from truly forgettable film. This picture should shown every amateur acting class example what not do. Thank God, Duvall went bigger and better things and stopped trying effect cultured accent. good character actor but that's about it. Klaus much better. His performance muted and noteworthy.,\n lot movies, often bring year old son, glad did not bring him this one. There are many references sex and skinny dipping scene, however, that not the primary reason would not take him it. The trailers lead you believe light-hearted comedy; nevertheless, virtually all the funny moments are the previews. kept waiting for get interesting, funny, anything but serious; however, nearly fell asleep the plot-less story dragged on. understand that dogs can great company, that being said, the entire story focused poorly behaving dog that the owners were not savvy enough train. human caused this much damage and mayhem that person would banned. The worst movie I've ever seen with Jenifer Aniston Owen Wilson, waste their talent. The best way sum this movie is, couple gets unruly dog, couple falls love with dog, dog dies, couple sad. The End.,\n He's stocky, sweaty, slightly cross-eyed and restless. stands front and calls himself pervert. claims that the film viewers perceive the screen toilet bowl, and are all secretly wishing for all the s**t explode from the inside. He's unpredictable and scary. Well Come on, you could have guessed now: he's one the leading philosophers our age.  Slavoj iek both narrator and subject Sophie Fiennes' extraordinary new film, Pervert's Guide the Cinema. Fiennes illustrates feature-long lecture iek, and does two ways: providing exemplary film clips and putting iek real (or reconstructed) locations from the movies speaks about. It's always nice watch neatly captioned scenes from great movies (although Revenge the Sith got here well), but the main attraction Pervert's Guide iek himself. What makes the movie such fun watch the unanswerable question one cannot help but ask over and over again: what more outrageous, iek's views iek's screen presence? documentary Astra Taylor (iek!, 05), Slovenian philosopher one point confessed his fear being silent. Because, claimed, feels like doesn't exist the first place, the only way make all other people believe does talk constantly and feverishly. And talk did, and how. Also Pervert's Guide dominated his voice delivering perfect English most crazy way, and making some astonishing points about the cinema.  What are those? Well, for example sees Chaplin's reluctance towards talking picture sign universal fear voice itself (kind alien force taking over the human being think the ventriloquist segment Dead Night [45]). says that the perverse nature cinema teach desire certain objects, not provide with them. identifies Groucho Marx super ego, Chico ego and Harpo id. says million other interesting things, and all the time cannot take our eyes off him, persuasive (and captivating) are his looks. some point couldn't help but stare his thick, scruffy hair and wonder what kind brain lays stored underneath. Craving, course, for more insights.  Most notable are iek's readings Lynch and Hitchcock (which comes surprise since has written about both them). The cumulative effect many brilliantly edited clips from their respective work made those parts iek's lecture memorable and unlike others difficult argue with, since seems really have gotten things right these two directors. This doesn't for his reading Tarkovsky for example, upon whom relentlessly imposes his own utterly materialistic view reality, dismissing precisely what's remarkable all Tarkovsky (namely strong religious intuitions and images).  The question isn't whether iek inspiring and brilliant, because is; whether Fiennes film worth watching, because likewise. The real question rather: are iek views coherent? One smart observation after another make for overwhelming intellectual ride, but after the whole thing over, some doubts remain. For example: while considering Vertigo (58) iek states that what's hidden behind human face perfect void, which makes face itself only facade: something deception its own means. However, when the final sequence hear about the ever-shattering finale City Lights (31) being portrait one human being fully exposed another, it's hard not ask: what happened the whole facade-thing Why should grant Chaplin's face intrinsic value the real thing and deprive Kim Novak's this same privilege two bold strokes maybe that incoherence might also read Lacan's terms? (The name the notoriously \"unreadable\" French psychoanalyst fundamental iek's thought.) The film has all the virtues splendid two-and-a-half hours lecture: lots ground are covered, many perspectives employed, even some first-rate wisecracks made (when iek travels Melanie Daniels' boat from The Birds [63] and tries think she did, comes with: want f**k Mitch!\"). But has also one shortcoming that isn't inherent two-and-a-half hours lecture such: it's almost obsessively digressive. iek's yarn about how far are from the Real good any other psychoanalytic yarn, but after some minutes becomes quite clear that one iek's perverse pleasures ramble and on, changing subjects constantly. Overall effect this being swept away giant, cool, fizzing wave: you're simultaneously taken surprise, refreshed, mortal danger and confused end. you finish watching, your head brimming with ideas not your own and you're already planning re-watching some films but you also share sense having survived calamity.  The ultimate question is: did iek lost it? haven't even came close the real thing? Once cinephilia becomes punishable imprisonment, shall all meet one big cell and finally talk each other (not having any movies around turn our faces to). dare you all: who will have enough guts approach iek and defy him? guess that once you look into those eyes real life, you become believer.,\n have say that Higher Learning one the top movies have ever watched. has brilliant cast, and equally brilliant director. Singleton shows how life University can be. There are main story lines, the skinheads, the African-Americans, and the homosexuals. was intrigued all the stories, but the one that got the most was the storyline about Kristen, battling her feelings towards another girl. The end was great. After seeing the movie times plus, still cry. would have given this movie 11, but have settlefor 10/10.,\n Arg. The shuffling dinosaurs are back take another bite out our sanity this all-awful third film. This time, European terrorists(Irish I'd say) hi-jack army convoy supposed transporting uranium. They pull into shipyard, open the truck and discover our old friends the carnosaurs. Pandemonium comes visiting then when the rubber dinos chomp the terrorists, the cops and some marines. The whole film seems (again) largely inspired from Alien(as Carnosaur was) with the pathetic marines going through the \"claustrophobic\" shipyard? guns the ready. This third opus probably the driest and ungoriest film the lot, with only one spurt blood when rubber dino rips marine's head off. The dinos are stiff, shuffling creatures usual and the T-Rex sounds like enraged elephant when roars(it also appears have eyes). One the goofiest scenes the film when the coppers arrive the scene: they enter the building where the hijacked truck kept and hear some weird noise coming from another truck. opening it, surprise! The Rubber Reptile Gang burst out and devour them. Why were the dinos locked the second truck after escaping from the first? How did they get locked the truck door could only locked from the outside? What was the point filming this scene???? bother, who cares? Both thumbs down for the Over-sized Rubber Iguanas.,\n have never seen such terrible performances all life.  Everyone the entire film was absolute rubbish.  Not one decent actor/actress the whole film, was joke.  Reminded drama school...,\n This film's kind like Conan the Barabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. There plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers don't good job showing it, which shame because 'could' decent story. Richard Hill gives solid performance the lead role, does the villain who sadly didn't appear anything else note. The fight scenes aren't too bad either love the way Deathstalker lets his sword 'drink' the blood his victims and there's plenty nudity and sex temper the general level machismo throughout.   All all, not good but not necessarily that bad either...,\n This complete and absolute garbage, fine example what BAD movie like, this can't appealing anyone, not even b-movie fans. not, repeat, NOT waste precious time your life this piece trash. Bad acting, bad directing, horrible (but mean really horrible) script, and complete lack idea what entertainment (of any form) is. bought the DVD for dollars, swear could almost pay someone take it. Burning would not enough for what this movie did me. like b-movies, the killer toys, the weird lagoon monsters, but this nowhere near. You know those movies that are bad they are funny? Not even. Just plain old pathetic.,\n Being transplanted New Yorker, might more critical than most watching City Hall. But have say that before even getting the story itself was captivated the location shooting and the political atmosphere New York City that Director Harold Becker created.  For example there's reference Woerner's Restaurant Brooklyn where political boss Frank Anselmo likes eat. There was Woerner's Restaurant Remsen Street downtown Brooklyn when lived New York back 1996. was fact particularly favored political people the Borough though they did have couple other hangouts.  No surprise because the script was co-authored Nicholas Pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories. knows the atmosphere quite well and sure knows how those two worlds cross they this film.  A detective played Nestor Serrano goes for unofficial meeting with relative mob boss Anthony Franciosa and things erupt and three people wind dead, including innocent year old boy whose father was walking him school. The story mushrooms and the end it's reached inside City Hall itself.  Al Pacino plays Mayor John Pappas and John Cusack his Deputy Mayor transplanted Louisianan, state which has tradition genteel corruption itself. He's the outsider here and trying damage control, Cusack finds more than bargained for,  Danny Aiello plays Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo and for those you not from New York, his character based the late Borough President Queens Donald Manes who was also brought down scandal. He's very much the kind Brooklyn politician knew back the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them, Aiello in.   City Hall was the farewell performance film for Anthony Franciosa, one the most underrated and under-appreciated talents ever the screen. one watches anyone else whenever he's on.  Al Pacino's best moment when the funeral the young child killed, takes over the proceedings and turns into political triumph for himself. His complex part, he's decent enough man, but one caught the corruption takes rise place like New York.   For those who want know about political life the Big Apple, City Hall highly recommended.,\n the very first episode Friends, which aired Sept 1994 \"The One Where Monica Gets Roommate\" there song playing Rachel sits the window towards the end the show, the line that plays is: \"If you ever need holding\".... does anyone know the artist singing the title the song? seems great song....I would love get copy it. Thanks for the assistance. looking for the album/cd can purchase it.   I have the shows which are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again. just seemed believable...thanks for the hours entertainment you have provided over the years.,\n I've seen the original English version video. Disney's choice voice actors looks very promising. can't believe I'm saying that. The story about young boy who meets girl with history that intertwined with his own. The two are thrown into one the most fun and intriguing storylines any animated film. The animation quality excellent! you've seen Disney's job Kiki's delivery service you can see the quality their production. almost redeems them for stealing the story Kimba the white lion. (but not quite!) Finally Miyazaki's films are being released properly! can't wait see uncut English version Nausicaa!,\n personally watched this see the footage the 60's and 70's. was fascinating learn how the drug movement essentially started and became pop culture and eventual uncompromising force life. The interviews the classic rock stars are titillating and humorous. You feel like you're secret and nodding your head the same time...because feels good and familiar. loved it, all segments from 60's-present day. highly recommend this for all aspects, including rock music, the hipper movement, politics and good 'ol history. check marked the box saying this contains spoiler, only because have idea what some might consider spoiler not this regards, since discussed what's all segments, just wanted safe.,\n This one the best crime-drama movies during the late 1990s. was filled with great cast, powerful storyline, and many the players involved gave great performances. Pacino was great; should have been nominated for something. John Cusack was good too, long the viewer doesn't mind his Louuu-siana accent. may come off annoying you can't stand this dialect. The way that Pacino's character interacted with Cusack's character was believable, dramatic, and slightly comical times. Danny Aiello was superb always. David Paymer was great supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. There were times when this picture mentioned many characters, probably too many. may take second viewing remember, \"which Zapatti was which?\" After many cross-references, one has stop and think just recap. The ending didn't have lot sting. was built for long and then was bit letdown. This was one the few problems with the film. Since the movie wasn't billed \"huge, blockbuster\" big screen hit, made some forget that this movie even existed. Pacino and Aiello were great but the film's lack \"splash\" the theaters may have accounted for nominations. was semi-successful the home market, and viewers are still learning that this title out there. Made 1996, still stands today and will remain popular for many years come.  So, make yourself some lemon pudding (you'll see) and see this movie!,\n This was one the worst Wrestlemania's I've seen. just didn't stand out all, really. Card wise, thought was going pretty good, but every match just seemed fall short.  Chris Benoit vs. MVP One the better matches. Benoit carried it. just didn't think MVP was that great, but Benoit saved this match.   Kane vs. Khali Wow, these two guys don't mix. maybe it's Khali and any other person alive don't mix. Awful match.  Melina vs. Ashley I'm not fan female wrestling.  ECW Originals vs. New Breed was excited about this match, until saw it. Really, Really disappointing.  Edge vs. Punk vs. King Booker vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Finlay vs. Randy Orton Absolutely the worst MITB match far. Just major let down, many people the ring the same time. just didn't live up.  Bobby Lashley vs. Umaga O.K. not extremely impressive, but not the worst the night.  Batista vs. Undertaker This was maybe the best match the night. Very, very, very nice see something good for change.   John Cena vs. Shawn Michaels really feel like this match deserved last. People make case for Batista vs. Undertaker, but this match was just good. starting get sick seeing Cena win every match though. It's getting little old. Now, have say, feel this match the best the night, but I'm huge Shawn Michaels fan, I'm little biased. Batista vs. 'Taker may have been better, but I'm biased, so...sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best matches the night and most everything else really came short.,\n What say about this movie. Well about bunch good students who have some bad drugs and turn into delinquent students that sell more the bad drugs people. Two those people have adverse effects one turns into toxic avenger type and his girlfriend throws some creature that grows the school's basement. That about all there and they stretch out for minutes. This movie pretty bad and should locked away forever. Though that not fair, some people like Troma's movies and they can watch they want. Troma movies for though, are the worst movies there are out there. just watched this one out morbid curiosity.,\n \"Ship Ahoy\" was probably made order showcase MGM talent. The film fun trip ocean liner its way San Juan, Puerto Rico, the time which the country was involved WWII. This was typical fare for the studios, which gave the movie going public light weight entertainment distraction during those difficult times the country was living.  The beautiful Eleanor Powell seen her best some musical numbers where she clearly shows she was dancer reckoned with. Red Skelton also seen straight part with not too much clowning, pursues the beautiful Ms. Powell the ship that bringing them Puerto Rico. The irresistible Bert Lahr has good opportunities the film show was funny man. Also Virginia Grey seen fun girl who not fooled anyone.  There are good musical numbers featuring Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, which one sees, among others, the amazing Buddy Rich, who has few solos with Mr. Dorsey and Ms. Powell. young Frank Sinatra appears also the lead singer the band, backed the Pied Pipers.  This nostalgic trip that should savored fans this genre, which MGM totally controlled.,\n cannot begin describe how amazing this movie is. Suffice say, anytime I'm depressed about how unfair futile things seem, this the movie rent put the right frame mind. The background music makes you realize the easiness existence and how simplicity provides for the greatest happiness. The Indian girl that sings but one example character this film who does not try hard, and happy result. Persifina, the laundry co-worker Ruby's (Ashley Judd) another=-her eyes and smile could make the hardest person's day. watch this movie and dream better days come good conversation with friends, and realize that being alone--Ruby alone quite often--isn't the same being lonely. Recommended for anyone who enjoys thoughtful lull movie.,\n ... than this ;-) What would happen Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams would have worked together one movie? This movie starts with touch Brazil... when, certain point, the story moves straight into the twilight zone... bringing nothing new, but just nothing... and nothing great fun! When Dave and Andrew starts explore their new environment the movie gets really enjoyable... bouncing heads? well... yes ;-)   anyway... this movie was, imho, the biggest surprise this year's FantasyFilmFest...  Just like Cube and Cypher Natali gave this one minimalistic, weird but very special design, which makes hard locate the place the story its time... timeless somehow...,\n   Dull Demi, going thru the motions. Ditto Prochnow. Ominous portents that elicit yawns. Michael Biehn trying dynamic, which ain't his shtick.  To quote Buffy Summers, \"If the apocalypse comes...beep me.\"  Going back sleep now.,\n Well, what say...  Having seen the film still have wonder what the hell the point all really was?? V.Dodgy camera moves the courtyard one point... had look away from the screen, was feeling physically sick... Round and Round and Round.... You get the idea...  VERY VERY Strange accents many points.... \"Those that should know, know\"  Unless your getting for free, being paid watch it, your partner about make you paint the house something.. then forget it...,\n This has got one the worst movies have ever seen. think) story rebellious college basketball player, his tough-but-fair coach, his girlfriend, and fellow student (played Michael Margotta) who has continual nervous breakdowns. The story goes nowhere, there zero character development, there nobody care about, and the performances, with the exception Bruce Dern the coach, are terrible. hard believe how talent like Jack Nicholson could direct such awful movie. Make sure avoid this turkey.,\n Anita and seems little more than excuse for Meera Syal, the author the novel and screenplay, air her prejudices, grievances and general antipathy towards the English. The general sentiment Indian superiority over the English this film foul.  The English people this film are portrayed overweight, violent, foul-mouthed, promiscuous, engaging child neglect, stupid, uneducated, racist, ugly, eating poor food, and dim-witted tellingly, only turning Indian culture can the local priest \"redeemed\" the end the film.  By contrast, the Indian family are beautiful, clever, educated, can speak many languages, are caring and loving parents, and grammar-school fodder. The film insidiously prejudicial that astonished the BBC funded all. Had been the other way round, English family Indian community depicted this way, the film would have been seen racist.  There were few moments where eyebrow shot far forehead, thought would lodge hairline. First, the gossip scene between the women the Divali celebration undertext: the English are dirty and promiscuous and the men undertext: English women are prostitutes. Second, the meal with Anita where Neema's family lie her about cutlery undertext: the English are stupid, you can make them anything.  But the underlying contempt towards anything English even English weddings are object scorn evident all the way through the film. The character Anita was drawn appallingly almost the fallen woman trope that finished the film feeling angry.  This not \"Bend like Beckham\" where the humour focused loving exaggerations community's behaviour and customs from somebody within that community, and film about two girls from different backgrounds coming together. Instead, Anita and seems convey that form cultural apartheid inevitable, the English are almost version the Indian Untouchable caste, and this underscored thinly-veiled series attacks upon the film's \"other\" community: the English.  I felt Anita and hate-filled, grievance-based piece work. that basis, the BBC should not have funded its production.,\n Made the unfortunate mistake seeing this film the Edinburgh film festival. was well shot from the outset, but that's the last positive comment have about the film. The acting was awful, wonder actual gogo girls were hired? But was the plot that was truly laughable, fact that was laughable and not boring the only reason gave this 3/10.  ** Spoilers below **.  I just want mention few the scenes that really got the audience laughing:.  Shoving the girl the field: who would have thought that kid shoving another kid could acted badly. real eye-opener.  The getting the bus scene: the girl getting the bus. But, according the music, the world ending.  The rolling under the clothes line: Wow, this one really demonstrates the plot writer's skills. the room, followed raw meat and skill selling. Why not just get her perform all three 'sins' once? least then the film might have been slightly shorter.  The running down the stairs the mall: watch one the girls takes flight down the stairs pursued flesh eating Dau, wait she *is* just walking quickly trying not break her nails.  The running covered blood: this definitely favourite scene, and fitting end the movie. half marathon red paint, completed vaulting stairs and over the bridge, only sent flying most unrealistically passing car. Not only this, but this suicide undertaken the most self obsessed girl the film, now that's sticking character for you.  I'd like think that this film was created year old and their mates. Sadly, having met the director the presentation, this not the case.  But, you're sarcastic mood, and fancy laugh with few mates.. then still don't even think about it.,\n scientist and his girl friend are out driving when his speeding causes car crash. escapes unharmed but she decapitated. saves her head, brings his house and keeps alive (!!!!). then proceeds search out models and strippers for the perfect body for the head. His crippled assistant watches over the head which starts talking and has telepathic (or telepathetic) link deformed monster kept the closet....  As you can see, this pretty stupid stuff, but had certain fondness for it. When grew the late 1970s, local station showed this movie about times each year (no exaggeration). They showed always Saturday afternoon TV--uncut. Seeing this back then was great! Explicit blood and gore along with gruesome monster and sleazy sexploitation--who cares was good? Seeing now realize how lousy this really is.  The acting perfectly wretched, the production values are nonexistent, the script pretty dumb and (aside from the still pretty disgusting gore) this dull stuff. There's also mild cat fight between two women and the admittedly great monster the end. Also add ending which leaves tons loose ends. one hand this interesting example 1960s exploitation film. the other its utter trash. Either way, it's not good movie but must-see (for one time only) for horror and gore fans.  Also the head's laugh pretty creepy. Note the end credits which gets the TITLE wrong (calling \"The HEAD That Wouldn't Die\")!,\n This movie such cheesy goodness.  A bunch people trapped abandoned school. They start getting killed off, they know they are being stalked, what they do? One girl decides take bath, another decides cheat her husband (who also there) with old boyfriend they somehow find bed (in old abandoned school?) and it.  And comes through with the gore and the T&A.  And it's also interesting from historical/sociological point view. Where the usual 80's slasher reflection how view ourselves, how adults view young people, Hollywood views the rest the country this has unique perspective. This Brit film made American slasher. It's hilarious see how often the British actors who are trying speak \"American\" unintentionally slip back their accents.  If you like cheesy 80's slashers (like Pieces) then you will like this one.,\n study bad. Bad acting, bad music, bad screenplay, bad editing, bad direction and bad idea. Pieces schlock don't come any cheesier unintentionally funnier than this... thing. the end the \"movie\", you are left wondering why did they bother the first place. Poor Malcolm McDowell, was short cash something? Still thinking seeing this? *SPOILERS AHOY*: you haven't died laughter the first thirty minutes, the time you'll see the cyborg-populated town named \"Cytown\", you will. Avoid this, movie-loving friends. Avoid.,\n Okay, I've tried and I've tried, but STILL DON'T GET this Guy Maddin thing. Tales From the Gimli Hospital left cold, that movie about the Austrian villagers and the one about the Ice Nymph were pretty look but lacking the story department...and this nudie movie about abortion and hockey just boring. I'm glad Maddin has appreciation for silent film, but dislike his films for the same reason dislike the films Quentin Tarantino: they're empty homages better, more imaginative films--films that advanced the art form broke new ground--and are all style and substance. amount jump cuts and odd camera angles can disguise the fact that Maddin unoriginal David Lynch wannabe, though DOES have one advantage over Tarantino: generally doesn't write embarrassing dialogue, because most his films rely intertitles. The bottom line is, Maddin's schtick clever clever film-making for aspiring film majors.,\n came the middle this film had idea about any credits even its title till looked here, where see that has received mixed reception your commentators. I'm the positive side regarding this film but one thing really caught attention watched: the beautiful and sensitive score written Coplandesque Americana style. surprise was great when discovered the score have been written none other than John Williams himself. True has written sensitive and poignant scores such Schindler's List but one usually associates his name with such bombasticities Star Wars. But opinion what Williams has written for this movie surpasses anything I've ever heard his for tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, fully keeping with the tender and lovely plot the movie. And another recent score his, for Catch You Can, shows still more wit and sophistication. Stanley and Iris, like education movies like How Green was Valley and Konrack, that one with John Voigt and his young African American charges South Carolina, and Danny deVito's Renaissance Man, etc. They tell necessary story intellectual and spiritual awakening, story which can't told often enough. This one excellent addition that genre.,\n Have you ever sat watching movie when minutes have gone and suddenly you realize that you have actually seen the movie before? That happened with \"The Young Graduates\". The cover the video box, you can find the video, extremely deceiving. I'd swear that the two women the cover aren't even the film.  Anyway, was either born decade too late appreciate the finer points this film or...it simply pointless junk. I'm heavily leaning toward the latter but guess some out there have developed connection this movie.  Hmm...plot. plot. Let's see...there must plot around here somewhere. Nope, can't find it. It's pretty much about some high school seniors acting dopey and doing drugs and speaking language that became outdated decades ago. One the female students has crush her teacher. The teacher has frigid wife (whom indeed refers iceberg) receptive the girl's advances.  There's lot driving around and inane dialogue and plenty spastic dancing. Our cat, BooBoo, was transfixed the dancing high school kids. She watched with amazing intensity the dancers gyrated and shook out the dance floor. It's nice see that least one species has found something interesting this relic. 1/10,\n This what happens when you're living China and the local video store running thin English-language titlesyou are blessed with this work what appears be, yes, Romanian cinema. Nevertheless, think that has real comedic potential.  Spoilers technically follow:  Though don't think that would fact spoil anyone's viewing pleasure ask why film set casino has scene beach archery, even flashback. That mystery, and many other conundrums, remain exploited desperate comedians, perhaps when they're stuck Bucharest.  Let also wonder aloud why perfectly good-looking people allow themselves abuse themselves film like this. It's sad.,\n This movie sort Carrie meets Heavy Metal. It's about highschool guy who gets picked alot and totally gets revenge with the help Heavy Metal ghost. such classic. The soundtrack A++++. You've got living legends Metal it. And Marc Price was great this film. This must have for metal fans.,\n way, Corridors Time success story because the movie reaches its goal being seen thousands. But fails making them laugh...  Les Visiteurs has had its success, because the subject was original way considering the time travel forget about Zemeckis's Back the future, here comes the old France, the middle-age knight and its nearly barbaric way life. Full pride, funny thanks the ancient words uses, Montmirail can sometimes disgusting but keeps his honor. Then comes the sequel.  Nobody had foreseen the tremendous success Les Visiteurs, the first. And it's use being movie expert realize that the Corridors Time has been made for money.  The general story begins after the end Les Visiteurs, and immediately tries justify the sequel with time paradox that would have needed some second tought. Explanation it's use trying get back the jewelry Jacquouille has stolen don't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car bought the end the 1st episode Where you think found the money Selling the jewelry... And that's only one many holes Poiré tries avoid... and fails.  Let's have look the characters Montmirail doesn't change, he's just little more boring. Regarding Frenegonde... that's another story Valérie Lemercier decided not compromise herself this sequel avoid getting stuck the bourgeoise role. And Muriel Robin tries imitate her way that found pitiful nearly felt pain for her. And Poiré doesn't realize that cast humorists isn't enough make good comedy.  Forget about the time travels, about the digital effects, concentrate the story and you'll see that there's enough room mail stamp write times.  The main interest this film the landscapes. movie for youngsters, let's say years old.,\n saw this movie the first time about twelve o'clock Saturday evening. really the perfect time for this one. have never, EVER seen movie that was actually more predictable and drenched with stereotypes. you want see thrilling action movie, don't watch because you might lose the will live halfway through. However, you want good laugh, please watch it! even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection thanks enjoyable Saturday night. What especially struck that évery scene that would expensive make was copy-pasted from Discovery documentary old TV-special the Army. Furthermore was amazed the fact that they didn't put the slightest effort making the production look real. Afghanistan is, far can remember, nowhere near any sea and yet with single click Deke escapes from the terrorists sand-castle with his jet-pack and taken away submarine (probably Discovery). Later the movie, Deke throws Islam terrorist against the wall. the slow motion scene you can beautifully see the long hairs the Korean stuntman flap the air when smashed against the wall. Gotta love it. recommend you watch with some friends and good amount beer though, only then you'll understand why I've been mad enough spend 6,99 euro's the box.,\n can say without shadow doubt that Going Overboard the single worst film have ever seen, and yes, have seen Cujo. Adam Sandler abomination Schecky Moskowitz, wannabe comedian working cruise liner. That's the plot. <br That's it! Nothing else the film makes sense, it's all over the place like mad man's breakfast, and not wacky naked gun kind way, but more frustrating, 'throw both shoes the t.v' kind way. even General Noriega makes appearance, for reason can comprehend (it certainly wasn't for humour). Add the mix Miss Australia, who has the worst Australian Accent i've ever heared, and you have something which won't call the worst film ever made, because Going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition film. highly recomend seeing this film, will elevate the standing every bad film you ever see. guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing bad film will \"at least wasn't bad Going Overboard\".,\n Did anybody succeed getting this movie?  It's total mess me: vague historical/sentimental context instead plot, pretentious imagery mise scene and lasts two hours!  Shame those who wasted money here.,\n Neatly skipping over everything from the coup Cuba his undercover entry into Bolivia, part two Soderbergh's portrayal Che Guevara that the tragic hero. with Che Part One, this rather rambling guerrilla warfare escapade through the colourful mountains Bolivia probably destined disappoint more people than will satisfy, why was the film (and particularly Benicio Del Toro's performance) loudly praised Cannes?  James Rocchi, for instance, called it, work art that's, \"not just the story revolutionary,\" but, revolution and itself.\" The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw called \"flawed masterpiece.\" return original contention for Part One that the value lies particularly depiction hero figure. And age when there surfeit poor hero role-models, could not salutary see strongly honourable one, even stripped some the less endearing episodes his life? This the psychological hero enshrined the great Scottish essayist, Thomas Carlyle, his seminal book, Heroes and Hero Worship. Heroes can real imaginary (or somewhere in-between). But should genuinely inspire higher goals, higher purpose. Compare this with the unrealistic 'heroes' standard Western storytelling: where person undergoes trials and tribulations before obtaining barely-believable reward usually everlasting love material wealth divine studio intervention. Real heroes have excess moral courage not Lost Ark dare-devilishness James Bond super-toys. They rise, and empower others rise, the best that they can be. Part One, Che succeeds. Part Two, fails. not for want moral courage but since not all good plans can succeed and being human, mistakes are inevitable.  Guevara's intellectual clarity flawed when equates conditions that justify armed struggle with conditions that make that armed struggle able succeed. serious miscalculation.  High the mountains from Paz, the colours are breathtaking. There air mise-en-scene authenticity that was occasionally lacking Che Part One (The U.S. would not allow Soderbergh film Cuba.) Visual treats are heightened maximising natural light and the extreme flexibility and realism offered with groundbreaking RED cameras. This high performance digital cine camera with the quality 35mm film and the convenience pure digital. Designed for flexibility and functionality, the package weighs mere lbs. \"Shooting with RED like hearing the Beatles for the first time,\" says Soderbergh. \"RED sees the way see organic, beautifully attuned that most natural phenomena light.\" Che had stopped with the successful Cuban revolution would have enshrouded him with almost mystical invincibility. That fails Bolivia shows not only that has human limitations but that his moral virtues that are remembered, not the political triumph. Critics will say and with some justification that his armed struggle inspired much less noble characters achieve tin-pot dictatorships. His development guerrilla fighting tactics are not good bad themselves (and have since been used for both).  But for all its praiseworthiness, the film often seems lack dramatic and narrative tension. stumble from one escapade another, knowing that will eventually meet his death. found myself glancing watch and thinking could have been shorter. But the work that has gone into this interviews with people from all sides and even getting one Guevara's ex-comrades coach actors the minutiae the Bolivian operations make the film commendable achievement. might not top-flight entertainment, but demonstrates integrity documenting significant slice history.  There also another very important point the Che 'hero' figure here. It's about failure. That you try your utmost, even you fail, your effort will not have been vain because may give others hope and moral courage. One could cynically call 'martyr' complex, and found, course, many religious figures well. But Che does not 'sacrifice' himself. does what does best, the best his not inconsiderate ability, and provides example. Success failure any particular instance become mere details.  With the U.S.'s longstanding and illegal blockade Cuba (all the name 'freedom'), tempted write that Che Parts are too good wasted the U.S. But that would invite contention that the film has sought earnestly avoid. One must hope that many viewers will have the skill view Che without politics and the bias that inevitably engenders. Whatever its faults, rehabilitates Soderbergh from the populist nonsense Oceans 11.  But you haven't heard Che Guevara seen Part One, you can't get past the phrase 'murderous Marxist' without frothing the mouth, might struggle imagine what you would get from this film. The same can said for many who have, and can.,\n Its Hollywood imitating Daytiem Soap Operas its finest! Its the fun that never see. Great characters and great lines. Whoopi hilarious.....Sally Field over the top....Gary Marshalls lines are riot....this what love about good comedies. Never afraid poke fun themselves!!!!!!The sets were great....wardrobe was point and the backstabbing \"Montana Morehead\" was devilish delight. Terri Hatcher \"Dr. Monica Demonico\" didn't have enough lines but none the less still gorgeous and fun when screen. would love know how the idea for this movie came up. Never have seen cast people have much fun making comedy work! Soapdish must have and waiting for the DVD!!!,\n guess that this movie based some kind true story.... It's about two young girls who molest grown man for 48hrs.; don't see where the terror comes into play here.... There are some \"weird' and \"surreal\" sequences the movie. And the two girls (Sandra Locke and...ah...oh well) play the roll two psycho-man haters the hilt...they pretty good job (although some just tad over the top). The movie's not good, and it's not horrible; it's just really really dated! mean this thing dripping with the 70's.... It's not really bad you like that sort thing...you know...that thang?,\n Yes, it's flawed especially you're into Hollywood films that demand lot effects, purely entertaining fantasy story plot, and you can't actually think for yourself.  Roeg's films are for the intelligent film-goer, and Insignificance perfect example.  The characterizations are brilliant, the story excellent, but, like all Nic Roeg's films has you thinking every level about aspects reality that would never have dawned you before. His films always make you think, and personally, like that film.  So don't expect come away from watching this film and feeling all happy-happy, because it's likely you'll disappointed.  But think it's excellent.,\n watch most movies that Nick Mancuso because, frankly, love the guy, even though ages typically cast the baddie (long-time fans should note that for some reason blond this flick). It's fairly familiar movie terms plot (but then most movies these days aren't exactly original), but Rick Roberts appealing the imperfect husband, Martha MacIsaac equally appealing the daughter, and Mitzi Kapture does good job, that was her goal, being angry and sometimes pretty hard like. Nick has still got terms being able demonstrate both charm and psychosis. However, too much the plot takes place off-screen like motivation, prior behaviors, good times and bad times and things that seem apparent the characters never quite make the audience (i.e., me). The final scene leaves everything desired the \"but what about...\" category, and overall, can't say that cared much about any the characters. That being said, was what was reasonably entertaining way spend the afternoon and still like Nick.,\n It's funny, when you stop and think about it: fright film fans tend deep and abiding affection toward those who scare the daylights out them. THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE may give nightmares, but who among (the Faithful) didn't feel very real twinge love for Gunnar Hansen BRUTAL MASSACRE- for Ken Foree, forever and ever the resolute hero the original DAWN THE DEAD? His cameo the remake made want stand and cheer (as did Tom Savini's cameo); kid you not. And Brian Halloran and... Well, you get drift (if not, just stand downwind...). These are some the Heroes Horror. see this many them gathered together single movie almost unheard (at least this degree, knowledge). only the writer(s) had been such monumental task. Maybe someone else, somewhere along the line, will try again. long it's not another half-hearted effort (like BROTHERHOOD BLOOD, for instance).,\n This movie difficult watch our fast-paced culture the 21st century, but worth for the messages that conveys, chiefly the consequences and ramifications technology upon society, specifically when that technology used for warfare.  This movie presents full circle cycle dehumanization and rehumanization influenced the advent technology and the subsequent deconstruction civilization and therefore serves cautionary tale against the misuse technology, but the circle completes itself, familiar themes and sentiments pop again present self-serving rather than self-destructive ways that humanity may utilize technology.  Brilliant for it's time, the picture and sound quality may pose challenge for some, but landmark the history, development, and evolution the sci-fi genre, must. the end, free will and free choice are once again posed humanity means for controlling our own destiny rather than having served someone else indeed, the state of  society itself, shaped world events.  Those who are downtrodden what life throws their way sometimes tend remain so, but yet there always glimmer hope and continuity that remains, this film posits.  As far qualifying sci-fi, one the biggest common demoninators that genre it's speculative nature. asks the questions, what these events happened this way, and what effect would have society the individuals within it? How would react?  As far influence, this film projects those speculative sciences that make sci-fi unique and keeps asking those important questions.,\n This film quite boring. There are snippets naked flesh tossed around lame attempt keep the viewer awake but they don't succeed.  The best thing about the movie Lena Olin--she does masterful job handling her character, but Day-Lewis garbles most his lines.  Kaufman clearly had idea how film this. The incongruities bouncing between domestic household/marriage issues and political crises are badly matched. Character attitudes change without explanation throughout. Badly disjointed.,\n Strange enough, all the previous comments merely described the beginning and left the details over. feel necessity confirm that this family work, since Marina Vlady was also Robert Hossein's wife, and the excellent jazz music was written director's father, André. Under these circumstances, wonder was really good thriller, seen when issued and immediately identified with the music. The suspense was flawless, and maintained throughout until the end. Robert Hossein, the time one the best European players, managed impose himself also top screen and stage director. He's still putting great stage shows, with preference for religious subjects.harry carasso, Paris, France,\n Where begin?   #1 Amitabh's son, played Akshaye Khanna, 30.

Pass really, complete and total waste time Oh! There great dance sequence (yes, only one dance sequence regardless quality) great belly dancing but NOT worth watching just for this.  Rent Veer-Zaara Lakshya (will Hrithik Roshan ever take acting lessons?) for better Indo-Pak conflict movies... fact, Veer-Zaara pretty damned good 7.5/8 I'd say!,\n Since the day saw this film when came out 1981, has been one top favorites. The blurb wrote for Amazon below, and I'm just thrilled that it's finally coming out DVD 10/17/06 the film's 25th anniversary.  The last credit this film explains its appeal \"Thank you the people Manhattan whose island this was filmed.\" charming and witty romantic comedy, love story written New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich native) who can identify every location (West 12th Street, the Ansonia, the old FAO Schwartz, the Plaza, the Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits which was country western club). One gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked well off-screen they on, and this intimacy clearly communicated. laughed, cried, was better than CATS. Not only ode Dorothy Stratten, was also Audrey Hepburn's last feature appearance (she had cameo subsequent this film) and her inner beauty seeps from the screen. Buy it, make big tub popcorn, and curl with someone you love.,\n first child was born the year this program came out, and played the record album for the boys every Christmas thereafter. When the came out, bought about ten copies and still give them friends and relatives they start families...it invariably becomes their favorite Christmas album. recently found several DVD's (made DVD-R from video tapes, probably) for sale eBay. The one bought was excellent copy, and was great see the show again after more than years. There are some songs the show that were not the album, and some the songs the album were studio versions the same songs the show. But both the and DVD will stay our library the best Christmas entertainment ever.,\n The title this film nearly put off watching it. Not being Manchester United fan, the mere mention Beckham was bit off putting, however put prejudices behind and I'm glad did.  I wasn't expecting much film, but was pleasantly surprised. The film sped along with never looking watch and enjoyed every second the film. you liked East East then you'll love this film. the storyline nothing new, and the classic storylines are contained within the film but it's all done very funnily, and with breath fresh air. The film moves very fast and keeps the audiance entertained. The occaisional funny moments are good chuckle and not some poor attempt humour, and best all it's good british comedy.,\n While was filmed Florida National Guard site, \"Tigerland\" totally reminded Fort Polk, LA., firing ranges, maneuver areas, waist-deep water and all. The movie was fairly authentic and the characters similar those same ones AIT 1974. The difference between the Tigerland year, 1971, and mine 1974 all the drill sergeants and instructors knew they weren't going back Vietnam, was pretty much all over, training was very relaxed not challenge all. That was the precursor all our troubles the 70s and 80s, which know for fact stayed until 2004. never heard anyone mention \"Tigerland\" but the Army did have realistic Vietnam training villages different bases across the U.S. Vietnam Vets tell that 1972 Basic AIT could pretty rough and rugged, because the trainers had been there and were mandated train Vietnam-bound men those skills make it, although that was not always the case. Both drill sergeant Polk and later one Vietnam Vet NCOs, when had become instructors basic training brigade Fort Bliss, told there was nothing they could get anyone ready and people just had find out and figure out for themselves. This movie rates high.,\n What fun b-movie! Shepis absolutely beautiful and the Scarecrow distinct and original. really brought back the monsters the 80's. The budget obviously low and not everybody Pacino behind the lens but doesn't matter because never once takes itself seriously. From the trailer trash redneck the high flying martial arts moves the Scarecrow, this truly b-movie gem. Grab some refreshments, snacks and couple friends and kick back and relax. enjoyed this film much went out purchased all Scarecrow films. Sure, they're not for everybody but each his own. Sometimes you just have set the thinking cap down and smile.,\n Yep, lots shouting, screaming, cheering, arguing, celebrating, fist clinching, high fiving fighting. You have general idea why, but can never 100% certain. naval knowledge would advantage for the finer points, but then you'd probably spot the many flaws. Not awful film Hackman Washington are their usual brilliant, but the plot was one you could peg pretty early on. I'm still waiting see submarine film where people get with each other don't argue, but then you probably wouldn't have film.  4/10,\n This was awful movie! Not for the subject matter, but for the delivery. went with girlfriend the time (when the movie came out), expecting see movie about the triumph the human spirit over oppression. What saw was hours brutal police oppression, with uplift the end. The previews and ads made mention this! Plus, for all that they played whoopi goldberg, recollection that she arrested and killed the first minutes! Again, the previews say nothing about this! (not that you would expect that, but it's just more the problem). had known how depressing this movie would be, would've never have seen it. least, would've been prepared for it. This was bait and switch campaign, and will NEVER see this movie again!,\n first Fassbinder was wonderful experience. Film and alternative cinema (small hall, with uncomfortable seats; public had wait while filmrolls were changed were perfect match.  There were many cliches used the film, but Fassbinder presented them cleverly that found them really amusing. Sound was also brilliant (sometimes back being louder than dialogue).  Everything seemed right place. And loved the way how after-war-time was presented. Real fun! <br,\n There are exactly good things said about \"Fantasies\" (both mentioned previous reviewer well):   a) Derek's extraordinary, poetry-inspiring beauty. She has shots this movie where she gives even Catherine Zeta-Jones run for her money, and that's high compliment indeed. Her nudity brief and discreet, but just looking her face enough.  b) The Greek island setting, with its sun and crystal-clear blue waters.  Other than that, there story, the dialogue abysmal and times unintentionally funny (\"He touched you where you're woman!\"), and Peter Hooten's character slimy jerk. overplays the naivete her character, but then again when you have work with dialogue this bad it's unfair blame the actors (the fact that she kept saying the name \"Damir\" almost every sentence major irritation). Oh, and although the film set Greek island, there hardly Greek word heard apparently everyone there, from kids old people, speaks English the whole time. (*),\n Remakes (and sequels) have been staple Cinema from the beginning the media. pretty much hit miss venture though. you take what's good the original and build upon and update key features too current standards, you can have success. Note, such films like THE THIEF BAGDAD (1924/1940) KING KONG (1933/2005) succeeded their attempts. Others like KING KONG (1976) fail, miserably.  BRIEF ENCOUNTER (1945) the template for this film. perfect could made such subject and rate IMDb**********Ten. The story simple, Love, innocently found accident and tragically lost. Why, just happened for the two (2) principals involved the wrong time. These are portrayed convincing and sensitive manner TREVOR HOWARD and CECILIA JOHNSON. Neither are conventionally leading Star material, but quality Character Actors. For the details watch the film.  Now what went wrong? T.V. Movie, remade practically scene for scene with name actors RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN should have least scored IMDb******Six. Both actors though appear disinterested, just showing punch their time-clocks and pick their checks. Neither are involved with their characters with each other. You not believe they are Love when they finally separate any great loss either them. That should not and that's why fails its intent. Sometimes just better leave things alone.,\n big fan low budget horror movies like this, but come on! This has the worst piece monkey S@#t have ever seen! ignored the reviews posted this site figuring that would fall into taste horror, but got bored and turned off.Let's see:  The wardrobe: Consisted cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot. The masks were made from what looks like tin foil.   The Gore: The Gore was pretty good, must give that. But Ittenbach's Burning moon was better for low budget movie.   Acting: Was horrible! didn't mind the dubbing. find this humorous like Ittenbach's \"Premutos\" (great movie). The fighting and action sequences were pi$$ poor.  Bottom line: Don't watch any Schnaas's movies. There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with movies the same gore and subject matter. Check Premutos, House blood, Schramm and the nekromantiks.,\n Take your basic Frankenstein flick, inject some Reanimator (but not the good parts), and you have Doctor Hackenstein. Certainly, this was obviously inspired aforementioned films but never materializes anything special its own.  A scientist accidentally kills his wife, the whole movie takes place over the course one night attempts revive his wife. revive his wife, decides chop off body parts from some women that have become stranded and, coincidentally, decide stay the night his place.  I can't really say the acting bad, nor the directing. Everything here just way too standard. What little attempts there are humor actually work (check out the scene when Hackenstein keeps hiding behind his deaf assistant because she would undoubtedly very upset she saw him clutching woman and needle), but that's hardly enough recommend this film. The music decent, what blood that's there decent, and the cast looks quite good. And for half the time, was even entertained this film. But never felt like this was anything more than time waster. Avoidable.  Try Frankenhooker instead.,\n One favorite films for number years was \"Last Action Hero\"; unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger decided spoil fun becoming corrupt scumbag politician; now can't bear any film may had hand in.  The Adventures Jake Speed actually toys with some themes similar those Last...Hero; was pleased find DVD, could watch these themes played out well.  Despite the \"plot-within-the-plot\" involving white slavery during African nation's civil war, this not action movie. The plot that the \"plot-within-a-plot\" within, actually about question that the film has intention resolve: Jake Speed real person that helping the heroine save her sister from the white-slave trader; actually fictional character (which means that the heroine has somehow entered the universe that really only exists series pulp novels)? suggest that this not all that clearly defined the film, and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are perfectly aware this. The film thus becomes presentation what audiences may want from such fictional \"adventure-story\" universe. That's actually rich theme, the potential heaviness which lightened the film's amiable and campy sense humor.  There are weaknesses the film primarily it's cinematography, which makes the film look like show. And the pacing does sag occasion.  But really like these characters, and enjoy the adventure they live, however silly. And just find fascinating the idea that this adventure actually taking place novel.  Holds under multiple viewings good show!,\n For every piece art judged these criteria: Form, Function and Meaning. Guernsey seems dedicated forms: nice shots and sometimes interesting acting. The long close ups suggest function that the viewer may fill himself. Because lacking texts the story becomes quiz. introvert person suggests have depth, but sometimes turns out has nothing say. This film acts like introvert person. you have not read the synopsis you cannot see that was the suicide (and the unanswered question Why?) that changes Anna's view life and makes her suspicious. 'Why don't you speak me?' asks Sebastiaan. Anna doesn't answer, she only starts looking long time him without saying word. What the function that shot? What does mean? question like Sebastiaans: What has this film say? What meant this movie? The answer for me: shows handful persons with the passion glass water. The story their lives simple and boring. Motives behind their actions are not shown. The rest is: skins, residences, landscapes. Nice and artistic done, but meaningless without having disposal 'instructions for use'. opinion this film made for fellow artists, not for the common viewer.,\n Wow. Simply awful. was fan the original movie, and begrudgingly sat through part was and improvement. 4,5 and Freddy's Dead were pretty bad. But NOTHING bad Freddy's Nightmares. Freddy acts Rod Serlingesq host this anthology series.  I can accept how Freddy became one punchline after another, but least the movies the appeal Freddy carried the movies, but here these were poorly made, they looked like high school productions horror series. The poor actors, you really want call yourself that after doing this show were obviously exactly what they paid for. I'm nearly certain this was stopping point for two types actors. Ones just starting the Hollywood ladder, brand new willing take any part that would put off their having take that porn job they were offered last week, seasoned actors their way down the Hollywood ladder willing take any part that would put off their having take that porn job they were offered last week.  I half expected Dana Plato guest star, but she was already dead the time this was production.  To paraphrase Nancy's line the original Elm St,\"What ever you try not fall asleep watching this.\",\n Burt Reynolds came point his career where appeared just going thru the motions. He'd show up, party with his friends film, and take home big paycheck. didn't seem matter him that the product was representing was pure crap.  No film epitomized this more than \"Stroker Ace\" which makes \"Cannonball Run\" look like classic and \"Cannonball Run II\" look watchable. Save for few race scenes there absolutely NOTHING worth seeing here. Even the beautiful Loni Anderson hams bad dumb blonde it's embarrassing.  If the thought Burt hamming with Jim Nabors and dressing like chicken sounds funny then this your movie. Otherwise pick almost any other film comedy and won't any worse.,\n know John Singleton's smart guy 'coz made Boyz The Hood, how did write and direct this? It's like the pilot bad \"going away college for the first time\" teen soap, parade boring stereotypes and cliches with some gratuitous violence thrown make commercial proposition, guess. Who would've guessed the date-rape victim would dump sausage for seafood? The angry loner would preyed upon group Neo-Nazis (and would roomed-up with black AND Jew just for laughs!) Even Laurence Fishburne's creepy reactionary history Professor just irritated and love the guy, it's like everyone involved with this movie just lost the plot. Except Busta Rhymes, course. Big ups.,\n think laughed twice. The line where the main character says something about being from the streets. And then forget the other time laughed. was probably the beginning.  This has one the thinnest movies ever. Doesn't Hollywood realize that this kind humor degrading and sad, really. You can only insult yourself many times.  2/10,\n After long period the space, looking for the remains planet Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns Earth. misses Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who got married and has son with Richard White (James Marsden). Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) plots evil plan, using crystals stole from the Fortress Solitude, create new land and submerge the USA.  After many delightful movies Superman with the unforgettable Christopher Reeve, shows like \"Lois and Clark\" (and Teri Hatcher) \"Smallville\", great expectation was created for the return Superman this Bryan Singer's version. Unfortunately, the awful story too long and boring, with many unnecessary parts, lack emotion and overrated IMDb. addition, the romance between Lois Lane and Superman something shamefully ridiculous. The twenty-two years old actress Kate Bosworth wrongly miscast, playing the role mature reporter and experienced mother five years old boy. Brandon Routh two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays teenager Clark Kent \"Smallville\". The character Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski, actually silly caricature. Last but not the least and spite being terrific Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey forty-five years old, therefore older and older than the rest the lead cast. The corny conclusion looks like soap opera and terrible. vote four.  Title (Brazil): \"Superman Returns\",\n the one and only season has just aired here Australia and thought was absolutely brilliant! love it! all the story lines are good! and its much more realistic view teen and family life today. yet still kept strong family values sticking together and being there for each other. their problems were real, and really drew you into the show. the show basically about this family called 'the Days' and their lives. the family consisted Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son). each episodes day their life, with coopers perspective things throughout it. loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great. was far favorite character. ended with many things could've continued with, I'm really sad another season wasn't made. was great show I'm gonna miss it.,\n What thrill ride! Twisted and thought provoking. Once again, Sharon Stone pulls off her drop dead gorgeous, spellbinding character author Catherine Tramell impeccably. The original Basic Instinct takes place San Francisco. The sequel takes place London, where Catherine has now relocated. Both bustling cities known for excitement, haute couture and perfect place for someone like Catherine Trammel take residency. David Morrisey, (\"Derailed\"), plays the smooth role psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass. The character David Thewlis plays Roy Washburn with Scotland Yard, refreshing departure from his role Lupin the Harry Potter series. Flashy cars, designer clothes, sex, drama, humor,tension, all the \"basic instincts.\" Mind bending throughout. Great screenplay. From the climactic opening scene the surprise ending, this film anything but boring! Everyone the theater was glued the screen.,\n Disney movie that dares something different should least awarded for effort. \"Holes\" doesn't make the same mistakes one would expect from Disney movie about troubled teenagers put camp. For the first time events are not explained details. The flashback scenes really serve purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer. must admit that first was bit put off the seriousness the movie. But soon realized that had endure those moments see the beauty the story. Besides the story this movie also does good job questioning some methods that are used correctional facilities. (One example where Caveman forbidden teach Zero read because they have dig holes order build character,like learning read won't contribute that). \"Holes\" movie that smart and beautiful. must watch!,\n *Spoiler warning*  First all rated this movie out 10.  The idea good, but there are too many stupid errors the movie, failing make the psyching drama that might have been. First all she never fights alone. After initial very strange doubt from her mother (which not believable when the mother proves supportive and loving later the movie) the rape victim not alone.   She also unbelievably naive always falling into the Crew's strange traps.   Her friends are unbelievably nasty.  The thing that find most unbelievably that Ethan fails control the crew when changes his opinon. Ethan very much the leader the Crew (hey, they even say so) and people seem think the other guy jerk, but when Ethan changes his opinion just doesn't manage convince even one single person the Crew that right and that his former friend wrong. Everyone just simply hates him... why?? The movie provides explanation. How did ever become the leader?  A funny note that girlfriend thought was watching Beverly Hills when she came in. Two actors from the same successful TV-series.... cheap way get viewers?,\n Things Come early Sci-Fi film that shows imagined world, \"Everytown\" through 100 years. You can break into about different scenes parts. The film spans from 1940 2036 and mainly about how this ruler the \"Boss\" wanted get the capability fly airplanes again, after Everytown was bombed and war broke out.  This film only has about faults: it's audio muddy and video had some quirks, the characters aren't deep all, and the overall plot isn't altogether solid. The plot lacking something that can't put finger on... just seems little \"fluffy.\" But you love sci-fi and are interested what H.G. Wells though might happened the next hundred years, this must see. It's worth seeing just learn what everyone was fearing: long, drawn-out war, because they were just about war with Germany, and there was threat biological weapons and everything.  Things Come pretty good movie that most people need see once.,\n saw this flight over the U.S and was little sceptical first few people had said there were many characters that you didnt get know any them. However didnt find this all. The film fast, but this due the nature the director and the star. The chase scenes are excellent and yes may predictable but isnt that true most films. The main villain bit let down, Christopher Eccelston not convincing could have been, but that said its still good film.,\n This, think, one the best pictures ever made. It's pure and beautiful. really touched me. I'm glad David Lynch proved that film doesn't necessarily need SFX, twisting, complicated plot flashy images. Way go,Dave. I'd like see Cronenberg that!,\n This VERY entertaining movie. few the reviews that have read this forum have been written people who, apparently, think that the film was effort serious drama. WAS NOT MADE THAT WAY....It extremely enjoyable film, performed tongue cheek manner. All the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us. The fight sequences are lively, brisk and, above all, not gratuitous. The so-called \"Green Death\", utilized couple occasions, not, read one review, \"gruesome\". couple reviewers were very critical the martial arts fight between Doc and Seas near the end the film. Hey, lighten up... Again, remind one and all that this fun film. Each phase this \"fight\" was captioned, which added the fun aspect. The actors were not trying emulate Bruce Lee Jackie Chan. This NOT one those martial arts films. Ron Ely looks great this film and the perfect choice play Doc. Another nice touch the unique manner which the ultimate fate the \"bad guy\" (Seas) dealt with. promise you that you don't try take this film very seriously and simply watch for the entertainment value, you will spend 100 minutes most enjoyable manner.,\n Now, I'm one watch movies that got poor reviews, and say, \"Hmm... this isn't bad!\" loved The Cable Guy, and thought that Big Fat Independent Movie was great. Keep mind, really didn't start watching this with high hopes, but figured that maybe... just maybe... would bad kind way could laugh it. was wrong. point all during suffering through this \"film\" (And use that term sparingly) was even close being mildly entertained. start, Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando when comes acting. hate rap music, but far could tell, Amish priest would probably make better rapper than him. The main character simply annoying, and not character that it's easy like. Quite frankly, would rather eat greasy turd out Harlequin fetus' bloody sores than watch this again.,\n long you into this movie knowing that it's terrible: bad acting, bad \"effects,\" bad story, bad... everything, then you'll love it. This one favorite \"goof on\" movies; watch comedy and have dozen good laughs!,\n It's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself. The paragraph-long \"plot summary\" written the movie page has details could not glean from watching the actual movie. found myself constantly backing see what details had just missed which could tell what the (bleep) was going on. Alas, avail--this movie leaves out monstrous pieces the story, you could call story. It's like they were trying fool into thinking that there was some kind movie here, filming just enough that there was the resemblance story and leaving the rest our imaginations. Newsflash the the creators: paid watch you MAKE movie. can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free. And Rosario Dawson? This somebody I've never paid enough attention able put the name the face, and can see why. She had one the most artificial performances have ever seen for leading character any movie, figured okay, maybe she didn't really want the role, just got hefty offer for movie she wasn't into? Wrong. She was listed one the producers. Next time you produce something, don't book yourself the lead you can't act. you really can, then create decent character for you become. Also, somebody here mentioned the white/latino issue--yes, hate say it, but this movie does come across act vengeance against white college-age males who wear baseball hats. That's what happens when there nothing the movie endear the watcher latino characters. The Adrian character seems like cocky jerk who better than the story's antagonist. for the Maya character, she didn't seem like real person. Anyway I'm ashamed for Hollywood that this movie was even made.,\n Finally, the uncut version \"Baby Face\" surfaces and from what source? The Library Congress. The restored four minutes, snippets here and there, make for much better film. now know that Baby Face was pimped her old man from the time she was least fourteen years age. Another reason d'tat for her behavior and cold, calculating exterior.  Barbara Stanwyck indeed amazing the role Lily Powers (notice the moniker), part that called for just the right amount sexuality coated with power, cunning, and revenge, yet tinged with virginal pretense when called for, very difficult portrayal make convincing. Barbara Stanwyck conveys the necessary nuances show that though she sleeps her way the top (literally), she still has good her heart--note the way she treats those few who have been kind her such Chico (the marvelous actress Theresa Harris) and the old philosopher. And though she exploits her sexuality make mush men who are rich and powerful, those same men are attempting exploit her for their carnal desires with intention permanent ties until they fall love with her.  Lily Powers fails understand, first, that emotions are difficult ride, that it's easy lose control. One possible result death. Hitching wagon star course materialism can take one destination where nothing else exists but the ephemeral, and it's cold lonely location.  A word should said about the philosophy Friedrich Nietzsche whose will power stressed \"Baby Face\" the elderly philosopher who befriends Lilly when she still turning tricks for her old man. \"Baby Face\" was released the same year Adolf Hitler came power Germany. Though it's highly unlikely that the semi-literate Hitler understood much about Nietzsche, considered himself Nietzschean the nth degree and touted along side his other rantings. \"Baby Face\" serves indictment the popular interpretation Nietzsche's will power concept, especially the final scenes.  Although \"You've got the cutest little baby face.\" apropos theme for \"Baby Face,\" even more telling and applicable melody Handy's \"St. Louis Blues\" played throughout the film, especially times when the camera has drift away from what would otherwise sexually explicit scenes. \"St. Louis Blues\" also used wisely toward the end Lily begins see beyond materialism eternal values. Chico singing raw, salacious version \"St. Louis Blues\" when Lily, now disagreeing with the lyrics, orders her stop.  The restored version \"Baby Face\" makes the film more modern its approach and attitude toward sex power than many new Hollywood release. all means watch this gem from the distant past and enjoy.,\n This film mind the weakest film the original Star Wars trilogy, for variety reasons. However emerges the end the day winner, despite all its flaws. It's still very good film, even lot its quality depends the characters that have been built the superior installments.  One problem here the look the film, which isn't very consistent with the other films. put lot that down the departure producer Gary Kurtz. The first films have that dirty, lived-in look with all the technology and forth. \"Jedi\" the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned. This makes for much less textured film. Also the creatures were excessively muppet-like and cutesy. this point seems like the film-makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality the film itself.  Another aspect its lack originality. Where \"Star Wars\" created whole new experience cinema and \"Empire\" brought alien worlds swamps, ice, and clouds, \"Jedi\" lamely re-cycled the locations the first film. First are back the desert planet Tatooine, and then are watching them face ANOTHER death star (maybe the emperor couldn't think anything new... but you'd think Lucas Kasdan could). Also have these ewoks, who really are just detestable made-for-mattel teddy bears, recycled version what was supposed the big wookie-fight the end \"Star Wars\" they hadn't run out cash. just feels like lazy construction.  The most unfortunate aspect \"Jedi\" for the weak handling the Han Solo character. Whereas central the plot the first films here struggling for screen time, trading one liners with the droids. Instead real drama we're stuck with the lame pretense that Han still convinced Leia loves Luke the conclusion \"Empire\" where she confessed her love him had never happened. The whole thing very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the Solo character was not part this film's central story after his rescue. Ford, for his part, looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances. This more like 1990s Ford performance, bored and looking \"above\" the film itself. Fisher for her part visibly high some scenes. Lando, interesting character introduced \"Empire\", here stuck the ostensible person care about the giant space battle. Only Hamill, given interesting development the Luke character, really able anything new interesting with his character. Probably was the only major actor the film who still cared about his work. And fair the script gives him lot more than the other characters. Really his story and the other characters are only there part the package. Ian McDiarmid does excellent work well the Emperor. The film would sink had been too far over the top (as was times the new films).  Visually and terms effects work, other than the \"clean\" look everything it's hard find fault. Jabba very effective animatronic character, one the most elaborate ever constructed. The space battles towards the end are very impressive.  Ultimately this film coasts success based the accomplishments its forebears. But its own, satisfying piece entertainment and IMHO far superior any Lucas' later productions.,\n Town Called Hell\" (aka Town Called Bastard\"), British/Spanish co-production, was made the heels Clint Eastwood's success the Italian made \"Man With Name\" trilogy. The template used most these films was hire recognizable American actors, whose careers were largely decline and dub their voices. This film exception except for the fact that they used some British actors well.  It's difficult summarize the plot, but here goes. The story opens with rebels whatever, led Robert Shaw and Marin Landau raiding church and killing everyone inside, including the priest. Fast forward the subject town few years later where the Shaw character masquerading priest. The mayor the town (Telly Savalas) brutal leader who thinks nothing meting out justice with his gun.  Throw into the mix grieving widow Alvira (Stella Stevens) who searching for her husband's killer. Add this the fact that she rides around hearse lying dead like coffin for God knows why. After the mayor murdered his henchman Bomba (Al Lettieri) the town invaded federale Colonel (Landau) search rebel leader (I'm sorry but the name escapes me). The Colonel takes over the town and begins summarily executing the townsfolk force them reveal the identity the leader.  Even though they opened the film side side, its difficult tell from the dialog that the Landau and Shaw characters know each other. blind man (Fernando Rey) claims can identify the rebel leader touching his face. does and..............................................  I'm sure the principals regretted making this film. It's just plain awful and well deserving dreaded \"1\" rating. Shaw spends most the film fixating his trademark stare whomever handy. Even Landau can't salvage this film. The beautiful Ms. Stevens totally wasted here too. Having just made Peckinpah's \"The Ballad Cable Hogue\" the previous year, found odd that she would appear this mess movie. Savalas made several these pictures, (\"Pancho Villa\" and \"Horror Express\" come mind) during pre-Kojak period.Michael Craig also somewhere character called \"Paco\".  Fernando Rey appeared many these \"westerns\" although would emerge play the villain the two \"French Connection\" films. Lettieri would also emerge with role \"The Godfather\" (1972) and other memorable roles before his untimely death 1975.  In all fairness, the version watched ran only minutes rather than the longer running times minutes listed IMDb, however can't see where extra minutes would make much difference.  Avoid this one.,\n Hopefully the score has changed now due brilliant and stunning review which persuades all you and watch the film thereby creating instant chorus \"8\"s, this movie's true score.  As mentioned before Chris Rock The King! Previous going see this movie wasn't that over the top about him but now I'm banging the doors Chris Rock's website begging him take his protege. This film truly funny, you don't find this movie funny you REALLY need therapy and it's humour which targets all areas society including race(predictably), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, stand comedy... the list goes on.  There was one slight disappointment for however. This was that going into this film didn't realise that was actually remake \"Heaven Can Wait\" another quite good movie made 1971 with Warren Beatty. such was quite surprised when watched this movie and suddenly the plot began unravel distinctly similar older movie had watched few weeks ago.. Regardless this movie opinion the better version out the two them simply because the different areas covers and the fact that Chris Rock funnier than Warren Beatty any second any day any week any year any...you get the picture.  Well the actual plot the film.  Don't spoil the experience for yourself! Don't read the plot! Just and watch movie because there have been two reviews IMDb far that have raved mad about it, see because the funniest thing you would have seen long time, and see because it's cinema experience that doesn't leave you grumbling nauseum the cost cinema tickets. see because good movie!,\n Wowwwwww, about hour ago finally finished watching this terrible movie!!! wanted turn off within the first like minutes but figured I'd give chance because just hadddd get better. least have some redeeming qualities, like figured the very least would make you think type movie, like really intelligent, very well filmed something...Needless say, that was not the case and wasted about hour and half life. not even going get into why its terrible because its waste time explain that this \"may contain spoilers\"...IMDb, you should calm down the spoilers thing and pay more attention making sure that the people who rate the movies and comment are not paid write good reviews involved somehow the movie anything else like that. thought would humorous after this terrible film come see hoe bad the rating would and was very very shocked see the fairly high ratings...all the ratings with about 7-10 stars clearly must about some COMPLETELY DIFFERENT movie... still big IMDb fan, but seriously rethink this rating process because this movie should rated higher than maaaybbbeee like,\n This only related the first movie the name. The plot has nothing with the first and the whole movie stinks!!! have idea what they were thinking but this movie bad. Avoid this all costs, the first movie the series acceptable slasher flick and the fourth but this one and the 3rd are rubbish!!,\n There are many incorrect statements this so-called \"documentary\" that found myself shouting the television.  Bart Sibrel might able produce flashy looking DVD, but sadly lacking looking the science behind his claims.  He relies either being inaccurate, not telling the full story, the old favourite \"government always lies us\" innuendos, and people believing what told them and not checking the accuracy details behind the claims.  What's more, his \"exclusive\" \"unreleased\" footage freely available over the internet from various sites.  Further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming this production shows that used false pretenses gain interviews, and has used creative editing the responses order promote his own opinions.  All the claims made Sibrel about \"inaccuracies\", \"mistakes\", \"whistleblowing\" the Apollo programme have been thoroughly disproven.  How get that 40-odd minutes life back?,\n The last believe) the movies The Boys made with Hal Roach, this also the last truly funny film they made, before going 20th century fox, which famously misued their talents. Although there are weak moments the business with the \"lung tester\", for instance, bit, ... overblown (but worth having, just see \"Dr.\" Jimmy Finlayson) but the whole this flick good summary what the boys brought the screen. Richard Cramer (uncredited) appeared other L&H flicks, and delightfully threatening here the convict Nick Granger. The scene where The Boys have eat their own synthetic meal (\"Looks good, smells good, and probably tastes good. Eat it.\") one favorite moments the oeuvre. Stan Ollie will always pleasant companions the lives their millions devoted fans.,\n sat through this film and have say only just managed keep attention. The film would have been bit more bearable did not have watch the awful CGI, for future reference the industry your going use CGI watch this you know what avoid.  Apparently this supposed graphic novel for the screen but all saw was bad movie which bears resemblance graphic novel whatsoever.  All all, the story was not bad the CGI, was quite impressed with the acting and thought the casting was good and little more character info would have been nice did get little confusing for occasion but that's not surprising like said only just kept attention, but all honestly wish had given this one miss.,\n While traveling train through Europe, the American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and the French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet each other and decide spend the night together Austria. the next morning, Jesse returns United States America, and Celine Paris.   \"Before Sunrise\" one favorite romances, indeed one the most beautiful love stories have ever seen. low budget movie with very simple and real storyline, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy perfect, and the dialogs are stunning. The direction amazing, transmitting the feelings Celine and Jesse the viewer. have just completed review number 1,000 IMDb, and choose \"Before Sunrise\" for this significant number because very special film for me. cannot understand why this movie was not nominated the Oscar, with such magnificent screenplay, direction and performances. Yesterday have probably watched this movie for the third fourth time, and still love it. vote ten.  Title (Brazil): \"Antes Amanhecer\" (\"Before Sunrise\"),\n incoherent mess with gratingly deafening sound track, \"Soul Survivors\" the latest entry the \"who's dead and who's alive\" genre horror films. Two teenaged couples, Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabel, prepare off different colleges, but before they part until Thanksgiving Break, they attend one last fling rave-type party some burnt-out church the suggestion lusciously slutty Annabel (Eliza Dushku, a.k.a. Faith, the other vampire slayer). Motiveless creepy guys start paying far too much attention Cassie (the generic Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons that are never explained, and before long, the quartet leave the party. Driving away their SUV, they are pursued and then passed the motiveless creepy guys, who promptly and inexplicably intentional 180 the middle the highway, causing nasty and fatal accident the SUV flips over embankment and plunges into river. Sean killed (or he?), and Cassie spends the rest the movie coping with loneliness and guilt (she was driving) when she's not being haunted Sean's ghost chased those motiveless creepy guys. Much unexplained incoherence follows Cassie's mental state degenerates further, until reach the predictable conclusion. So, who dead and who alive? After ninety minutes this purgatory, who actually cares?,\n Um... Okay, guess get the whole shaky-cam, gorilla-style filming technique but unfortunately think gorilla could have made better movie... This thing was just complete mess from the get go. Bad acting, bad directing, bad story and horrific cinematography. How this piece garbage was released will never know, but has and unfortunately watched it. Filmed location Tennessee the directing team Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd), \"Five Across The Eyes\" I'm assuming supposed resemble \"Blair Witch\" type film but falls short... Okay nose dives off cliff. was actually embarrassed for these young women, whom I'm sure were promised Hollywood stardom, but ended this dung heap. The dialog ridiculous, and actually aggravates you you listen it. How this supposed horror flick another mystery, there nothing even remotely scary about it, except for the fact that watched it... Try this one for size: There you and her, the math and beat her ass... \"The End\". Saddly went (and on) for more minutes mind-numbing stupidity...  I saw for free, and wanted money back.,\n This film, which based true story, comes from first time director and long time actor, Denzel Washington. Denzel Washington has given some the best performances the last decade, black soldier the Civil War Glory, and lawyer the acclaimed Philadelphia. And course, made special notoriety last year when won the Academy Award for Best Actor Training Day, which Denzel Washington became the first African American receive the award for Best Actor. guess Denzel wanted change pace, chose direct Antwone Fisher, which also stars. Fisher played Derek Luke, who new the silver screen, but has made some guest appearances such television shows King Queens, and will appearing the upcoming film release Biker Boyz. <br This truly well done film from Denzel Washington, considering was his first time directing. Undoubtedly, Denzel felt some kind commitment and believed the real life story Antwone Fisher. Antwone Fisher about young African American man the Navy who constantly gets into fights, and after one particular brawl sent see Navy psychiatrist named Jerome Davenport, played Denzel Washington. Davenport helps Antwone deal with his troubled past and learn move with his life, finding his birth mother who had give him birth because she was prison. What makes this film good the fact that it's not overly melodramatic. was expecting something little more like Good Will Hunting, with lot swearing, fighting and vulgarity. Not that didn't like Good Will Hunting, the swearing, fighting and vulgarity the film were out place. Quite the contrary! However, Antwone Fisher true story, and don't think that Washington wanted sensationalize the story for dramatic affect the film. Don't get wrong, there are moments when see Antwone fighting, carrying and having moments when seems like the world closing him. After all, his first session with his psychiatrist, the character played Washington, Devenport asks Fisher where was born, and Fisher's response is, `from under rock,' obvious jab the pressures waning Antwone Fisher's soul. But had appreciate the fact that this film wasn't sensationalized for dramatic affect. think shows real character the part Denzel Washington deliver more realistic story and avoid the typical clichés that are common Hollywood films, even those based true stories. One other point that would like bring about Antwone Fisher the acting. Over all, performances were good the film, but not great. times, think was bit obvious that the main characters were actors, but overall, complain about performances this film would ludicrous. One actress that would like point out this film Viola Davis. She plays Antwone's mother, but she says barely two sentences the movie all, but not much because she appears the end the film, but more because she shock that her long lost son, Antwone has found her. What would like point out about her actress the lack use her. She basically character actress, and haven't seen her play any really elaborate roles. She made appearances Traffic, Out Sight, Kate Leopold, and two recent films: Far From Heaven and Solaris. Steven Soderberg's remake Solaris, she played scientist doomed space craft orbiting planet. that film, she confronted George Clooney's character and she drawn tears what Clooney tells her particular scene. When first saw Solaris, remember seeing her tear the scene and thinking, wow, this woman can act. was you could feel the character's grief. that brief shot her face, she gave much expression and honestly felt very sorry for her character's sadness and trouble the film. think she has definite potential actress and should used more often perhaps leading roles, rather than just character driven actress. Nonetheless, Antwone Fisher very good movie. Denzel Washington, always, pulls off great performance and gives great directorial debut. Also, Derek Luke very talented actor. think that Antwone Fisher will bring his immense critical fame for his portrayal the troubled man, but think that his public popularity will increase with the release Biker Boyz, which also stars Lawrence Fishburn. Antwone Fisher based the book `Finding Fish: Memoir,' Antwone Quenton Fisher. ***,\n Julia Stiles talented young actress, who with guidance from reputable agent has lot potential. Obviously, the person who guided her into this travesty not someone who cares anything about her career. sat the theater surrounded teenagers who left droves find another movie sneak into wondering who thought this movie would appeal anyone. was poorly written, the casting director could only have put minutes effort into the characters and the director obviously didn't care.,\n Power Rangers, the completely awful kid's show from the 1990s still continues disturb young children with it's complete cheesiness, and awful settings.  This show was not entertainment, was excuse teach children violence showing kids how fight one another order solve their differences.  The toys were further demonstration how promote violent television show and such.  I have never been able figure out what the purpose this completely ridiculous show ever was.  As such, remains one the worst kids shows ever made.,\n Rain shine outside, you enter movie house. makes you happy. (If not, come right out.) Lights off. You settle down with bar ice cream. Moving pictures begin flicker the screen. You feel content. the dark, you are back the beginning time. Sitting around the campfire...looking the modern version the flickering flames times per second and sharing the joy discovering the unknown turns and twists the scenario with rest your clan/spectators.  Those who are not happy with themselves, should not write comments. (Long live romantic comedies...),\n This one and \"Her Pilgrim Soul\" are two favorite episodes this new version Twilight Zone. mentioned comment the new series, there's something lacking this new series. Maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has learned. It's little bit more mawkish and sentimental than Serling's version. However, this episode can considered quite sentimental too. think the appeal that matter what they do, the lovers can never unite. remember wasn't surprised the Korean movie \"Il Mare\" (later remade into \"The Lake House\". think it's because saw this episode first ruined the impact the later film.,\n had high hopes for this movie. The theater monologue great and Nic Balthazar very interesting man, with lot experience and knowledge when comes movies.   I fan lot Belgian movies, but this movie bad. It's completely unbelievable that actors who are are suddenly playing the roles teenagers. The \"linguistic games\" were hideous and over the top. Nothing about the film seemed real me. The ending was way too deus machina for me.  I very disappointed and think wasted hour and half life.,\n Ok, let say that didn't expect film starring Jerry Springer cinematic gold, all asked for was cinematic...and wasn't even that. looked like someone's bad home movies. Poorly acted, scripted, and filled the brim with nudity the most unnattractive people I've ever seen.  The film's \"plot\" focuses low-class family who decide the \"Jerry Farrelly Show\" discuss multiple affairs between mother, daughter, stepfather and the daughter's fiancee. From there, the movie fizzles and develops into unique experience: white-trash pornography. There's redneck sex, interacial sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This film encouraged want run out the theater and get second circumcision. least was mercifully short. Disgusting and degrading. African-Americans and working class America should offended. (Howard Stern should pleased however, didn't squander his attempt for film stardom. His was smart, funny and entertaining)  MY GRADE: (the daughter was hot),\n Love it, love it, love it! This another absolutely superb performance from the Divine Miss From the beginning the end, this one big treat! Don't rent it- buy now!,\n love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega attractive, appealing and talented actress. I'm sure that this would have been good movie had anything happened it. Nothing does. It's short (less than minutes). was minutes too long. After hour frustration, scanned through the remaining 20-odd minutes. Excruciating.  Freeman plays actor who hasn't worked while researching part that might play, checkout clerk supermarket. visits the supermarket where she works. Nothing happens. She decides give him ride home and they Arby's, Target, car wash. Nothing happens. They converse about their lives. Nothing happens. Ever.  I don't get it. But also don't get the Bill Murray flicks \"Lost Translation\" and \"Broken Flowers\". you like those movies, maybe you'll like this. Lots people find movies like this whimsical, charming, for reasons that escape find the dialog fascinating. common device movies this ilk have LONG take stillness/silence after actor delivers line that's supposed meaningful. know it's meaningful because it's followed two minutes nothing the screen. Sorry, must philistine. don't get it. me, these kinds movies aren't funny, charming, thought-provoking. They're just boring. Why? Because there's comedy. drama. tension. laughs. suspense. action. Nothing watch. short, none the things the movies for. can bored for free. see oddball/quirky characters real life. Target, and fast-food restaurants, and car-washes. These elements not movie make, even stars are doing this stuff. pay entertained.  If you're crazy about Morgan Freeman and just like hear him ramble about nothing, have fun. you wanna drool over Paz Vega, you can look and listen her. But nothing happens, promise. total snoozefest.,\n really enjoyed this movie about the relationships that sometimes developed between American servicemen and Japanese women post-war Japan--as well the obstacles that prejudices created for them. Brando goes from having contempt for the Japanese (which natural considering WW2) falling love with Japanese woman and wanting marry her. His performance okay not major fan his acting style) and the movie marvelous throughout. Red Buttons received Oscar for his touching performance another who falls love Japan (though the Japanese women who plays opposite him also did remarkable job).  I don't want spoil but the movie good one watch with box tissues.  This movie manages say SOMETHING and entertaining the same time. mostly underrated gem.,\n Underneath the dense green glop computer graphics there gleamed the astounding art and skill Ichikawa Somegoro. Alas: got lost all the goo. The scenes Old Edo with the courtesan, drifting the Sumida, rehearsing and acting the Nakamura-za were all exciting and engaging, taking you back interesting and rich era. The action the Kabuki stage, which Somegoro excels and excites, was more enriching than any the absurd high jinks that followed. The skill, the energy the audience, the colors the sets, were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over plot and performance. What wasted opportunity! One the best kabuki actors alive, and gets lost the dreck.,\n First off, the movie was not true facts all. just saw the documentary few days earlier and the movie wasn't anything like it. First all Nash was genius mathematics and this what the movie should have been about not story about man who was cured and who found love the end and on. Also there are lot scenes that were just plain wrong the scene where rode around with bike the campus happened his early university years not after it. opinion Russell Crowe didn't fit this part all since doesn't look the intelligent/individualist type, therefore really couldn't play one. would have been great would have focused more the mathematics (similar Pi) and not the over-dramatized lovelife. this level ABM was too hollywood-ish and too superficial great. Personally think wasn't mad nor paranoid and was onto something since people that caliber tend know more than \"lesser mortals\". 5/10,\n Vivacious irrepressible, ANNE GREEN GABLES brings unlooked-for happiness into the lives lonely old sister brother Prince Edward Island.  Lucy Maud Montgomery's well-loved novel comes life this wonderful little movie. Excellent production values, literate script and first class performances gives the story exactly the touch quality deserves.  Taking her professional name from the character she portrayed, actress Anne Shirley joy the red-headed fourteen-year-old orphan who completely alters the lives her new guardians. Completely assured her starring role, Miss Shirley delight, entertaining the viewer with Anne's boundless imagination, quick temper and not-so-secret sorrows.  Playing the stern spinster who gives the girl home, Helen Westley also completely commands her role; the viewer will enjoy seeing this sharp-tongued woman slowly unbend Anne's affection and child-like innocence. Australian character actor Heggie gives one his finest performances Westley's shy, gentle brother who welcomes Anne into his heart from the moment arrives fetch her from the railroad station.  Tom Brown most agreeably plays the schoolboy who quickly grabs Anne's attention. Sara Haden appropriately prickly nosy neighbor. Charley Grapewin makes the most his few moments Avonlea's doctor.,\n Writers Perry and Randy Howze crafted very engaging little story \"Chances Are.\"   Using the idea reincarnated man who happens return his former wife's home many years later, the plot takes unexpected, delightful turns.  Twenty four year old Robert Downey, Jr. renders delightful performance, ably assisted Cybil Shepherd the widow and Ryan O'Neal good friend.   This trio has just the right chemistry for this caper, playing off one another with graceful style. I've watched this film number times tv, and each time found most enjoyable.,\n Lupin sets off for Morocco, looking for legendary treasure. His only clue interesting jewel that old man gave him. It's nice different location for Lupin, with the desert and that hot exotic feel.  One interesting thing about this movie that Jigen has much smaller role than usual, generally being different place than Lupin. one hand their classic dynamic together missed, but change pace. Plus, this way, Lupin can focus the ladies...  Fujiko rules this. Throughout the entire feature she seducing Lupin, and viewers. Then there's Lara, the damsel this particular tale, and she's quite likable. This one has more nudity than any other Lupin anime, which fun distinction have.  There's very entertaining effeminate ninja guy who's the best villain this, and naturally has some great fighting with Goemon, well some fun scenes with Fujiko. Inspector Zenigata course also warpath here, fine form.  Pretty much, this smooth ride with Lupin. The plot average and there are some slow spots, but all all this movie real pleasure. Enjoy.,\n others have noted, this movie criminally inaccurate its portrayal the artist's life and for one was very annoyed and offended... its transformation her rape into tragic love affair, the implication that her rapist was responsible for 'awakening her talent,' its complete disregard for her work, the way turned her into sex object, and on, you get the idea. Also, find disturbing that people who aren't familiar with Gentileschi will see this film and walk away with that kind impression her.,\n This low budget film with cast unknowns and minimum location shoots. The Philippines substitute for Thailand and nobody actually goes Hong Kong. The stock shot Cathay Pacific jumbo jet landing the old airport makes the transition perfectly. This film proves that you need neither mega budgets nor headliner star produce excellent movie. contains neither the gaffes nor the excesses that young filmakers often stumble into. Solid workmanship from people who know all the aspects movie making and who understand the compromises between art and box office. excellent piece work!,\n honest, didn't like \"Executive Decision\" which was obvious the template very much, but compared this piece crap, looks like masterpiece art.  Not only that the people moving the film (the term actors would insult for all other actors) should attend more acting classes, the guy who build the setting hasn't even seen aircraft from afar. ridiculous, that 747 only flight attendance are aboard, but this only the tip the iceberg. The film full illogicalness (e.g.: use sleeping-gas, then don't use it, then use anyway), which dropped rating finally the bottom.  You can have more fun rearranging you sock drawer drilling hole your knee and fill with milk.,\n has got the best spy/adventure series had ever aired. The whole idea telling story hour real time period dazzling. The style filming and pacing what hooks watch it. And Jack Bauer one the greatest protagonists series long time. rate this, along with The Simpsons and The X-Files, three most favorite series.  This first episode begins with the conspiracy assassinate Senator David Palmer who also running for president. Bauer called his office order discover who behind all this and, the same time, figure his daughter's path the unkwown after fleeing from her bedroom. Thus, begins adventure the best political style and, what's best it, that always takes place real time, which makes this series real work originality time where almost every program seems showing the same things over and over and over.,\n really liked this movie. Kurt manages act without speaking, letting moments speak for themselves. doesn't have verbalize rationalize his actions, simply decides and takes action. supported good cast actors and settings, and able show more humane side soldiers without getting corny.,\n Paul Greengrass definitely saved the best Bourne for last! I've heard lot people complain about they way filmed this movie, and some have even compared the camera style the Blair Witch Project. All have say that is...are you kidding me? Come was not that bad all. think helps the action scenes feel more realistic, which would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography. for the rest the movie really didn't even notice it.  You can tell that Damon has really gotten comfortable with the role Jason Bourne. Sometimes that can bad thing, but this case its really good thing. really becomes Jason Bourne this installment. Damon also has great supporting cast Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer, and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was great addition the cast, added more depth the secret CIA organization.  Even though the movie filled with great car chases and nonstop action, they managed stick fair amount character development their with all that going on. This film stands far above the other two Bourne movies, and definitely one the best movies the 2007 summer season!,\n the storyline wasn't depressing enough, this movie shows cows being butchered graphically slaughterhouse for all five minutes while the protagonist narrating her early life butcher. Weird stuff. Then there's the core premise the hero/heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because he's besot-ten with work says would have gone with him was girl. this person psycho, masochist, just doomed queen who takes things too far? And what sort traumatic childhood did have? Just that didn't get adopted and had live out with nuns who first loved him and then later hated him because was unruly. tries explain the reasons did what did, but it's really really hard empathize. Such sad and unusual self destruction. Was supposed funny? What was all about really?,\n Simply awful slasher, molded from the KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER type fodder, has beautiful wealthy college students spending spring break Florida condo being murdered one one. misfire every category imaginable from properly built suspense the executed death sequences..nothing handled properly and the characters leave little more than caricatures you root see decimated quick possible. Del Tenney(The Curse the Living Corpse;I Eat Your Skin), all people, executive produced, co-wrote, and stars priest pivotal role whose relationship the killer guess means something why he's psychotic. The revelation the killer awkwardly handled and ineffective, probably not surprising soul who watches it. There are lot attempted jump scares, with one character popping out frighten their friend, which couldn't even manufacture few cheap thrills, because they are calculated such tepid way. Most the attacks occur off-screen with bleeding throat cuts(..or pools)representing the only real display violence. The protracted finale, where the killer goes and with the actor desperately trying make his villain diabolical and demented possible, embarrassing and tense-less. There's not one single positive derive from this clichéd and dull exercise with the pretty cast making little effort rise past their one-dimensional roles. And, for pity sake, they could've least allowed see Joey Lawrence get decapitated something for withstanding the misery sitting through this junk heap for agonizing minutes.  Dorie Barton, the heroine final girl, Beth Morgan, who the killer seems obsessed with, couldn't more vacuous and uninteresting(..oh, she was rehab, and takes pills for her nightmares;such intriguing exposition). Chad Allen, cast against type very intimidating \"friend\" the group(..who happens disappear from the film first, setting the idea that he's the first victim), has tough hill climb with his role, steep eventually stumbles, rolling uncontrollably with end sight. Jeff Conaway, needing some cash guess, has the beleaguered FBI agent role, whose daughter's murder motivates him seek out the killer, leading him Florida. Jack McGee has his usual a$$hole role smart-mouth Florida Police Chief who often nose nose with Conaway's agent.  Oh, the answer the title's question..not really. Because once you get the answer, you will wonder why you bothered with this anyway.,\n Universal's answer \"The Exorcist\" isn't very good one. Unfortunately, the film offers bland, unimaginative direction from Michael Winner who wastes outstanding cast with screenplay massing crater-sized plot-holes. Not mention, it's unbearably silly never explaining certain key elements within the story.  Model Cristina Raines moves into high-rise owned the Catholic Church with creepy, blind priest John Carradine, who holes there always the window. She begins suffer faint spells and nausea. What's worse tenants she meets the building such Burgess Meredith(with cat and canary!)and young Beverly D'Angelo lesbian. Ava Gardner(looking great 55)is the Realtor who showed Raines the place. Cristina's lover Chris Sarandon, whose wife \"committed suicide\" after finding out they were having affair. José Ferrer has small role the \"Priest the Brotherhood\" who informs Monsignor Arthur Kennedy careful heads the very high-rise not only housing Carradine but Raines well. Sarandon sends hired-hand the high-rise one night check out certain room above Cristina's apartment where she heard metallic clanging and other loud racket. winds dead the very same night Cristina \"kills\" her DEAD father nightmare. Screaming mad the street, Cristina does indeed have blood her which leads police detective Eli Wallach and partner Christopher Walken investigate them with sure certainty that all somehow leads back Sarandon who hot-shot lawyer who once beat the cop court regarding the whole wife's suicide. That case really motivating factor Wallach's dogged approach finding out whose blood was really Cristina and Sarandon has anything with it. You also have Martin Balsam professor who understands this type Latin Cristina mysteriously understands and unbilled actors such Jeff Goldblum fashion photographer and Tom Berenger man interested this certain room that has become available the very room(now renovated)that Cristina once stayed in! What bothers more than anything lack explanation. Towards the end the film Wallach and Walken are forgotten and are left wondering why they just and quit investigating. Their characters are just left the back-burner. How the priests know that \"now the time\" when certain man will die and must replaced guard certain gate that high-rise and why Cristina suffers through the trauma she does isn't adequately explained. How certain ghosts just appear Cristina and disappear when she tries show Gardner the rooms they occupied during cat's birthday(see for yourself)isn't adequately explained. Not mention Gardner's role the grand scheme things..she brings people that high-rise, but what really her reasons the film? seems like this film should've been longer and cleared things left lost rushed conclusion that just laughable when should scary.,\n While contains facts that are not widely reported, not exactly the truth. They took lot liberties rearranging events, excluding people, and using sets that not meet the facts their lives the 30's. There were more than just Bonnie, Clyde, and W.D. the gang various times, and those people had much with the facts those included. Buck and Blanche went convince Clyde straight much earlier than the one shootout, and fact got drawn back into crime. Some the events that were portrayed daylight actually took place night. Bonnie's wound was much more severe and never healed right. was bad she had carried around someone until healed up, and even then stiffened she walked stiffly. Clyde also walked with limp because while prison cut off big toe. know, I'm being nit picky, and was movie, but even without these factual errors this \"TRUE\" story, the movie moves too fast from event event and comes across more several separate snapshots their lives, rather than being cohesive flowing story.  I'd recommend reading book seeing documentary you want get closer the truth.,\n Released just before the Production Code crackdown July, 1934, Mitch Leisen's all-star Paramount musical leeringly suggestive -some even claim misogynistic- and highly entertaining. Two murders occur the opening night \"Earl Carroll's Vanities\" (one on-stage!), but that doesn't stop the manager (Jack Oakie) from putting show lascivious police detective (Victor McLaglen) investigates. Everyone hiding something and Gypsy Rose Lee must have seen this backstage murder mystery before she penned \"The G-String Murders\" the denouement similar (although more satisfying here). Gertrude Michael, vicious diva, stops the show (in more ways than one) with her exotic \"Sweet Marijuana\" number and Duke Ellington finishes with the truncated \"Rape The Rhapsody\". The hit song, \"Cocktails For Two\", came from this film. bizarre and bawdy camp classic highly recommended! Here's Louella Parsons the \"Los Angeles Examiner\" May 17, 1934  Earl Carroll's hand-picked beauties' pirouette about the Grauman United Artists screen fig leaf and not much else. But September Morn herself never had better figure than these charmers, who are made please the eye, especially the eye the tired businessman. But don't for moment think Mr. Carroll's girls, naturelle, are the only attraction. Believe not, MURDER THE VANITIES musical comedy thriller, you know what mean murder mystery incorporated musical show. all happens the opening night the time the play progress and search for murderer. Just way suspense, cop threatens stop the show every few minutes. Victor McLaglen something new cops. All the time trying track down the murderer, keeps his eye fastened the chorus beauties. The murder mystery good with the exception the denouement, which pretty flat. Probably faulty direction. Dorothy Stickney, who plays the maid, about melodramatic the heroine ten, twenty, and thirty show. For good reason, she rates never-ending closeup the big dramatic scene. The girl ensembles are good, and it's positive relief get away from the inevitable overhead shots. The costumes are beautiful; fact, this musical that Paramount can feel really their credit. for Carl Brisson -well, would addition any show. Good-looking with delightful singing voice and easy, assured manner, all his press agents claim for him. also like Kitty Carlisle, who plays the leading lady the show. Gertrude Michael, the deep-eyed villianess, gives interesting rather fictional portrayal. Jack Oakie, the stage manager, the same old wisecracking Jack, but wouldn't change him. Jessie Ralph excellent the seamstress. Others the cast are Charles Middleton, Gail Patrick, Donald Meek, Barbara Fritchie, Toby Wing and Lona Andre. The screen play Carey Wilson and Rufus King, and the direction Mitchell Leisen. The music Arthur Johnstone and the lyrics Sam Coslow. addition MURDER THE VANITIES, there Mickey Mouse cartoon, Paramount Newsreel, and two-reeler, THE WRONG DIRECTION.  I disagree with Lolly the denouement, it's satisfying over-the-top. Why would she blame the director? Was she displeased with the story's ending -or the way was staged? And what's \"ten, twenty, thirty show\"? Note the swipe taken Busby Berkeley and his \"overhead shots\". hard may believe today, the public was tiring Buzz' schtick May, 1934. Mitch Leisen said, \"if you are showing stage show that's supposed theater, you should stay within the bounds the proscenium arch, and not Buzz Berkeley routine with stage set that's acres big.\"   Q: Don't you think Berkeley's spectacular effects justified taking this liberty? ML: Apparently they did because they're reviving all his pictures and none mine, but personally don't like it.,\n This movie needs put DVD. was funny and loved it. Really, really cute and funny. Not realistic, but not suppose be. The only thing did not like about was the girl relying the guy too much. represents the time period way thinking though. have been trying get this movie for long and has been unavailable for format only the and will not play DVD players. sadly over looked Classic film! Believe not, but this film could easily become cult favorite, for all ages. Too bad, not legalize certain things that could really save small countries our own. Lindy unsinkable, positive character that makes lemonade out lemons. She funny and charming. She stole the show!,\n had chance see screening this movie recently. believe that will theaters Canada some time around Mother's Day. theater near you... GO! It's not funny feel-good movie it's more along the lines feel and think movie.  The director does excellent job character development letting you into the heart, mind and hurts Hagar little little. first, her attitudes and behaviors don't make much sense. her story unfolds, she becomes someone you can understand. life... understanding brings empathy. found her likable the end the movie particularly when she opens her heart the young man the shack the lake.  Hagar's relationship with her two sons painful and reflective many our own experiences this world. Her youngest son, John, who full life and adventure takes the viewer the very edge their seat and into the kind raw emotion that authentic and rare.  It's fun see Ellen Page acting this movie. She very different than the young woman that she plays Juno. gives even broader appreciation for her acting ability. you loved her Juno, you'll love her The Stone Angel.  Of course, there Ellen Burnstyn Hagar. There likely way expressing the power acting strongly the ability for the actor make you forget every other character they have ever played. Never once the course this movie did ever think Ellen Burnstyn always and only thought Hagar. She swept into her character hook, line and sinker.  Kari Skogland's capacity capture film this renowned book one Canada's most cherished authors impressive. She brilliantly brings the screen both the stoney and angelic parts this complex woman, Hagar the stone angel.,\n rented this movie when came out video tape and really enjoyed it. had the opportunity purchase DVD few weeks ago and have watched several times since. would have agree with others when they said Indian Summer was nostalgic film. When watch wish that could 10-14 again. think that why all like the movie some extent. all times wish that could relive our lives children with the wisdom/knowledge adults. Wouldn't nice have all your friends/parents young again? not have worry about your job, being parent etc...??? know that would like jump into Lorean and back time. While enjoyed the film very much all time favorite camp film though Meatballs with Bill Murray. wish that they could make Indian Summer version that.,\n Standard procedure for Swedish movies today seem start throwing plausibility out the window and continue down that path for the rest the process. Rånarna another fine example movie making very little sense.  Banks Stockholm are being robbed highly efficient \"military-styled\" gang robbers. Two police officers start investigating the case that soon becomes more complicated than would appear first.  As usual Swedish film the cast mostly made the same people you have seen over and over again. Mikael Persbrandt must every Swedish film from the last few years! But that's guess since Persbrandt one few that performs solidly here (like usually does). The problems with this film mostly revolves around the story itself. First all the robberies feel mostly like background. Rather this more movie about young policewoman fighting prove herself male world (like that has not been made thousand times before with decent actress instead Sofia Helin). Also there completely unbelievable plot twist near the end that seems about plausible Aliens landing. But still, did think was quite nice touch considering was half asleep right about then. spiced things bit (and actually saved the rating from dropping another step).  In the end the main problem the same thing with most other Swedish movies this kind. Simply that the action and suspense doesn't live the standards are used from other movies this kind (mostly Hollywood). feels cheap and rather weak comparison. opinion Swedish filmmakers should try focus more plot and acting, and forget about trying make \"Hollywood-action light\" like they now. Because this becomes yet another forgettable effort from the Swedish movie-industry. rate 3/10.,\n get the Diehl character s'posed microcosm America itself seeing Arab terrorists under every rock, only find out the end that it's his own actions all along that got him into that siege state and truly practices good-will all men everything will rainbows and lollipops. Sorry Wim you have made amazing movies the past that stay neutral the politics and for good reason, polemics are your weak point and they weaken this well-made, amazingly filmed movie with absurd characters, dialog and plotting. Better luck your next flick. Another thing that yanked crank was the belabored point the homeless section being there for reasons hunger, these people don't get enough eat. Truly these folks aren't eating regally but the real hunger these folks spiritual hunger, emotional hunger, mental hunger. They need self-respect, self-worth, dignity which you can't give man. Yeah those folks are hungry and they need available. Less the center for hunger America, would say it's more the center for alcoholism, drug-abuse, mental suffering and economic devastation. Dealing with hunger although noble endeavor band-aiding more profoundly systematic societal and age-old human problem homelessness. Bill Diehl was good though and Michelle Williams was cute the young yet (cliched) old soul.,\n 666: The Child starts plane crashes, the only survivor flight 666 was young boy named Donald (Boo Boo Stewart) who adopted news reporter Erika (Sarah Lieving) her cameraman husband Scott Lawson (Adam Vincent) after they covered the incident for Channel news. first Donald seems like any normal kid but death seems follow him around, after warnings from Nun Vicar Scott begins believe that Donald evil the cause all the deaths...  This straight-to-DVD horror flick was directed Jake Perez under the pseudonym Jake Jackson one has say 666: The Child really rather poor. Whenever see The Asylum responsible for film get worried, get very worried since their track record awful. They seem specialise making &/or distributing low budget horror films which are usually rip-offs some recent successful big budget horror film the case 666: The Child you don't need degree rocket science realise that it's complete rip-off cash the recent The Omen (2006) which was released the same year. The script Benjamin Henry Austin Laurel terrible simply can't match the ambitions the the Hollywood equivalent, mean just what exactly does Donald the Antichrist expect achieve from middle class family small town? It's hardly great starting point bring about the destruction thew world it? Every character 666: The Child some form the main character's from The Omen, the adopted parents, the Priest who tries warn them the sinister babysitter. There's real lack incident, there's barely any gore the plot poor. mean Donald killing dentist because they were trying fix his teeth just random needless, what were all the disgusting pictures Donald drew all about, where did the babysitter come from there's just nothing that ties everything together it's just disjointed mess that just becomes very boring very quickly. The references the number also becomes annoying are very unsubtle.  Director Perez does alright suppose, it's competent nothing else. There's virtually blood gore, there's few sprays blood, cut off hand someone gets circular saw stuck their face but sounds lot better than looks screen. It's certainly not scary, there's atmosphere thanks throughly bland contemporary setting suburban house there's tension because never really know what Donald trying there fore there's threat from him.  Technically the film alright, it's reasonably well made but since the actual film poor makes little difference. The acting isn't that great but the same time I've seen worse.  666: The Child poor mans The Omen rip-off, I'd sooner watch either the original the remake over this any day the week. Not good definitely not recommended. Followed the sequel 666: The Beast (2007) which also went straight-to-DVD.,\n Ronald Colman plays famous Broadway actor who has begun lose his mind and sense identity. After years playing wide range parts, can't remember who exactly is--who are his roles and who the self. And, much more serious, begins see and hear his play even regular everyday life. So, since he's currently playing \"Othello\", begins act jealous and suspicious--just like the title character. Ultimately, leads him the depths insanity and murder.  I saw this film years ago and liked it. just saw again and loved it. Now perhaps some enthusiasm because have always liked Ronald Colman and this great triumph for him--and for which earned the Best Actor Oscar. And, looking the competition that year (Gregory Peck for GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT, John Garfield for BODY AND SOUL, William Powell for LIFE WITH FATHER and Michael Redgrave for MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA), think Colman was very good choice, stretched from his usual comfort zone and did much more demanding role.  Now noticed that one reviewer hated this film because they hated Shakespeare--and this took about half their review talking about their dislike for him. However, this film isn't really about Shakespeare, and doesn't matter all you dislike Shakespeare. huge fan Shakespeare, but marveled the small portions the play that Colman re-enacted--though, said, this NOT really movie about Shakespeare. Instead, it's wonderful portrait actor losing his mind and mixing his stage role with reality. could have been ANY play, though \"Othello\" was excellent choice because the murder scene--which gets acted out for real later the film.  Overall, very clever film due lovely script--with some overtones Film Noir. Fortunately, the acting was terrific also, Colman had excellent support from Signe Hasso, Shelly Winters and Edmond O'Brien (who was particularly good--he played his part just right). And, considering the great George Cukor was directing, it's wonder it's wonderful film from start finish.,\n never like comment good film but when comes bad movie, gotta come really hard it. Talking about Vivah, this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, seems have completely lost it. After success Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, thought can make money with cheesy wedding videos. Vivah cheesy that Badjatyas have left Johars and Chopras behind.  There was not single moment during the movie where can say 'Oh! least this thing good'. Aloknath does cliché role Girl's father, Shahid kapoor looks fat and Shahrukhed, Amrita rao another disaster addition ugly looking sets, bad costumes, hackneyed storyline, monstrous stepmother, trying-hard-to-act actors, cacophonous background music, cheap soundtracks.  Now the spoiler, I'm warning you guys that happens all his other movies, after calamitous incidence movie ends happy note.,\n read some previous comments stating that this movie loses steam towards the end the movie and also that has similar ending Cape Fear. completely disagree. I'm going give simple review for the normal moviegoers out there. thought the casting was perfect. thought this was one Harris's best performances. What evil psychopath!!! have lot respect for his acting after viewing his performance this movie. was riveted throughout this movie. you like mystery thrillers then this definitely movie you want see. also noticed young Scarlett Johannson this movie. This movie filled with top stars and highly recommend it!,\n First time saw this movie was the eighties, but reviewed now this thriller still actual. Some newer movies focus similar topics, but they not match this french milestone.  A president obviously Kennedy gets shot open car during public appearance. The resulting huge investigation finds the \"Lee Harvey Oswald\" figure this movie guilty, but one member the jury insists further inquiry. reveals some surprising evidence ...  Unlike Oliver Stone's JFK movie with the same plot this one does not play with emotions, but concentrates exciting description conspiracy and how everything fits together, drawing new picture the assassination. Even real psychological experiment used for this explanation the crime scene. Compared JFK this movie more reasonable, intelligent and thrilling. Parts the plot can found lot newer movies, had kind deja sometimes sitting the cinema.  \"I... comme Icare\" \"must see\". Its unique and brilliant, and the music Ennio Morricone wonderful. This movie deserves very good ranking, was Hollywood production would famous for sure. <br,\n the very thought Arthur Askey twists your guts, don't worry, you can still watch and love The Ghost Train, like the equally marvellous Back Room Boy, film that simply too damn good sunk single performance, even that the lead actor. Personally, love Askey, perhaps it's because into his world, rather than unreasonably expecting him come into mine, which mistake too many people make. The Ghost Train intensely atmospheric that you couldn't conceivably watch without being amazed the deep, dark world transports you to, immersive way that few cheap and cheerful flag-wavers managed during the desperate early '40s and it's film that would imagine few people have ever watched just the once. The cast are, without exception, extraordinarily good, perhaps Linden Travers lays bit thick, but against the backdrop lonely railway station wartime, she could hardly play nutter and not stand out. The sad passing the lovely Carole Lynne earlier this year broke the last link had with this incredible film and now really the past, but waiting patiently for press play.,\n Very interesting. The big twist wasn't big shock maybe they had hoped for and was very dated but did get mind working. really got thinking about world without vegetation livestock and made appreciate the world live lot more. Charlton Heston does good job, all the supporting characters, and was very realistic film which was surprising. lacked direction times and lot the settings and background needed more explanation but was still surprisingly good and intelligent movie. The main fault that could find was that didn't want the film end when did, would have liked see what happened next.  7/10,\n The reasons watch this knock off... err... tribute great movie called Se7en: It's while your channel surfing and there's nothing else on. Someone pays you watch it.  Do yourself favor and pop the DVD for Se7en, rent it, download iTunes, put your Netflix cue and skip The Flock entirely. The Flock the same story with with few changes. Furthermore the editing just wreaks Se7en and actually ends taking you out the story several times. The worst one probably the fly over desert helicopter shots, with sounds people people chattering over the radio, except there are police helicopters flying overhead this one.  Bottom line: call blatant knock off. you wanna nice you can call tribute film, ahead, but either way watch Se7en.,\n Those the \"Instant Gratification\" era horror films will doubt complain about this film's pace and lack gratuitous effects and body count. The fact is, \"The Empty Acre\" good example how independent horror films should done.  If you avoid the indie racks because you are tired annoying teens twenty somethings getting killed some baddie whose back-story could have come off the back Count Chocula box, \"The Empty Acre\" the movie for you.  Set the decaying remnants the rural American dream, \"The Empty Acre\" the tale young couple struggling with the disappearance their six-month-old baby. the couple's weak relationship falls apart, larger story plays out the background. night, shapeless dark mass seethes from sun baked barren acre their farm and seemingly devours anything its path, leaving sign that was ever there.  The film loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues what happening, and ends with well executed ending that resonates with just enough left over questions validate the writer/director's faith intellectual audience.  There seems sub-text concerning the death the American dream, but would hardly call the film allegory. Riveting, well acted, and technically astute, \"The Empty Acre\" fantastic little indie that thinking horror fans should love.,\n was probably one the few Australians not watching the tennis when this series aired. have say when William McInnes first appeared though, that one crappy actor! But the series continued toned down his performance and totally loved him. was such rotten guy but did make laugh. watched the show see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bones, The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). was interesting see Speers play nice, quiet man and even more interesting watch Tom Longs' rippling muscles! Sigh... Seriously, Long's performance was total shock and really brilliant. stole the show. Martin Sacks was good also small role, and the leading actress put entertaining performance. I'd recommend this programme you enjoy stories with twist and watching Tom Long walk around with shirt on...,\n someone who lives near Buffalo, New York, this movie scored points with before even saw it, since the story based here. There are even some bit parts with real-life news-TV anchor people from Buffalo..and, for once, doesn't knock the area. Hallelujah!  Theology-wise, puh-leeze!!! God still made look and think like humans...and, course, bit the liberal side. Being the lightweight comedy is, it's nothing that should win any awards but still entertaining and pleasant way kill 102 minutes.   There are some laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy scenes and, hopefully, audiences from Christians atheists.- got something out this besides few laughs, such what prayer should really all about. Kudos the writers for least getting that theology correct and giving good message.  Overall, it's good-hearted film that should offend very few.,\n Well, the endless quest for horror, will come across this film, apparently re-released DVD recently for some ungodly reason. The transfer awful and the quality just sucks. don't think this due bad remaster anything, just think the film poorly done.  Obviously filmed abandoned school with budget that was doubt wasted cheap beer and talent hacks, \"Slaughter High\" starts out slow and doesn't pick pace until about hour in. First, get see 'nerd' picked group of...I actually don't even know what they were supposed be...jocks? The ringleader, with his ultra hooknose ugly should have definitely been cast the nerd. Then, there 'big guy' and couple dumb losers and chicks who are supposed 'hot' but aren't. It's mystery why this group rejects picking one their own, but guess the viewer assume these are 'cool kids' picking dweeb. The casting choices are horrendous most the high schoolers are played thirty-somethings. other reviewers here have pointed out, the actors (if you can call them that,) are bunch Brits whose accents slip out numerous times throughout this piece crap. are left assume that this group 'children' were the only students this school, their 'reunion' only them the school, which now shown abandoned, just them.  The kills are lame, the gore not great and the script like Scooby Doo with real people; lines like: 'This place gives the creeps...' and 'Someone gimme beer' are highlights...It's just not good. Skip this one unless you are getting wasted with some friends and wanna laugh real lame attempt slasher. you wanna see good, get Bava's \"Bay Blood,\" done years earlier and heck lot better. you wanna see good BAD slasher, see \"Just Before Dawn\" \"The Burning.\" out 10, kids.,\n Did you ever wonder how far one movie could go?   Schizophreniac relentlessly explores the world the extreme with Harry Russo.   Harry aggravated writer, killer and drug addict scumbag who will stop nothing destroy those who stand between him and insanity. Driven the demonic voices his ventriloquist dummy rubberneck, Harry begins his killing spree.   From director Ron Atkins comes the 1st installment the vilest story ever filmed  The only other movie have seen similar this would happen the 2nd installment entitled Schizophreniac Necromaniac  This really low budget film and will not for everyone, but you are looking for something disturbing, different and horrific then this would make fine choice.  DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING LIKE MODERN DAY HORROR (Such Scream)  Viewer discretion advised,\n thought this was awesome movie. The theme song sweet! Anyway, the only thing that somewhat bothered was the beginning, when everything should have been normal. was very weird and unrealistic. The big cable company mainly what I'm talking about. Apart from that, the movie was very creative. think that all the acting was well done, the actors acted out their characters' personalities perfectly. Everything fit together well. really shame that their isn't soundtrack. That would have been great! Because this Canadian film, and because one favorites, give this movie out 10!,\n About five minutes in, and saw where this was heading. Bunch high school kids get annoyed the school's administration and thoughts rebellion start fomenting. said girlfriend: gets below IMDb, I'll and read book. got 5.0, she persuaded watching. What are the good things? Well, good thing this film does not have story, because you would surely distracted from the editing. It's like the student's drawing that was torn one the teachers, all the footage for this film was cut freak accident involving meat-grinder, and left half the stock destroyed, with the other half spliced into two-second bits. Even ten-second scene the local news, there are about six cuts and three different angles. And then there are the montages. These are all set electronic music, which forewarns you yet another montage, that like Pavlov's dog you start cringing every time you hear it, which about every three minutes. Oh, was supposed say what's good about this film. Well, the film was shot very well, with nice color palette, that nicely matched the emotional content such there was the scenes. Okay, now with the film's major flaw, and wasn't the story, lack thereof. The director made that fatal mistake leading you astray about people and situations, not clever storytelling, but being highly selective about what show about the main characters. That's just cheating. guess did order make the central character more likable. But just became plain annoying. the story full holes, it's good trying patch misdirecting the viewer. And often there wasn't even any point it. And then the ending. Basically, the main villain the peace turns out okay guy, coward. Plus turns what seemed the whole point the movie, that you should stand for just cause its head, the already mentioned misdirection, and makes into point about the nature revolutions, that was already made, and much better, animal farm. also committed what call the Bill Cosby sin: matter how things may seem first, the end adults are always right, and children always wrong. And let's face it: unless you're me, that's just not true.,\n wonderfully quirky film with enough twists for sack pretzels. Parker Posey plays Fay Grim sexy, vulnerable, loving mother who may may not what she seems. The story very tongue cheek, and the dialog skillfully understated. Hints humor and intrigue, neither which overpower the characterization Posey pulls off well. The supporting cast stellar. The downside? This film needs your full attention, almost the point stopping the film and taking notes. Posey has more sex appeal her lifting eyebrow than most actresses have their entire body. She's worth your time, even you don't understand the denouement.,\n Really started the 80s trend disgusting violence masquerading \"horror film\". was the target audience for this repellent piece trash and was disgusted then now.  Oh, where start. Let's see, the setup: You can bring people back live they died violent death. that laughably weak premise the excuse butcher people horrible ways, because, well, that's needed bring them back life! This might have worked played over the top for black laughs Re-Animator something. But no, it's played straight. There whole terrified family wagon that gets hunted down, one the few scenes least where their demise off screen. However, just about everything else screen. There actually scene where young girl walking along beaten and killed zombie townspeople, who are all filming and grinning with several cameras. Then, there closeup her face the filmmakers lovingly--and time consumingly--reveal time-lapse photography her beaten face being carved down skull and rebuilt look \"normal\" again. This done, course, slumming Jack Albertson the mortician behind all. likes drive around ambulance/hearse playing old Tommy Dorcey tunes, guess that supposed cute.  In the end, course, even the Sheriff undead and the doctor offers kindly fix his rotting hands. Not clear why the Sheriff not out with the other townspeople killing children with glee and slicing their faces off, sticking needles burn-victims eyes, etc.  I wonder, really wonder, what people see geek show like this give any kind rating all. It's not scary, the twists are laughable, and overall it's kind sick. It's not even well enough done \"see dare\" enjoy level you might watch bad Lewis film. It's just God-awful trash, made for people who get off this type pointless gore, and made people slumming for paycheck.  Sad that Albertson was even involved.,\n saw this film SXSW with the director attendance. Quite few people walked out, and the audience could barely muster even polite applause the end. the films I've seen this festival, Frownland among the worst.  At 106 minutes, least minutes too long. You get watch the main character's failed and drawn out attempts communicate, extended real time. The same grimaces, hand over mouth motions, kinetic and frantically repeated words and syllables over and over and over again GET THE POINT.  One site actually compares this work early Mike Leigh. What drugs would you have make that statement? Given that Frownland Captain Beefheart song, maybe you'd have able enjoy Trout Mask Replica heavy rotation appreciate this film. Unbelievably, this won jury award the festival. You can bet did not win audience award.,\n 'Ninteen Eighty-Four' film about futuristic society which the government controls everything and one can trusted. very dark film, and one that will not make you feel good about yourself. about romance taking place this society and the betrayal the lovers and about human nature being self-centred. The film has some very good ideas and done well portraying this society with the dark tones colours (contrasting with happiness and bright colours the dreams) and general feeling loneliness through objects and people and places. However, despite the film's cleverness portraying this idea, the film was very slow and did not seem quite get the idea across. seemed spend too much time being clever rather than telling story.,\n Those you who, like me, were disappointed with the original 1995 horror yarn, \"The Fear\" will find more disappointed with this silly little sequel. sort follows similar plot, but impossible connect the original, with the exception the presence Morty, the mannequin monster made wood. Here brief overview.  Twenty years after Mike Hawthorne (Gordon Currie, decent performance) witnesses his father brutally murder his mother and then take his own life, Mike still suffering from the fear that day. hopes ridding his fear, Mike takes his girlfriend and bunch friends his grandparents' home. His plan for everyone dress costumes that represent their fears, and then present the fears the mannequin Morty. According Indian friend, this process supposed magically take away one's fear. What Mike doesn't know that Morty possessed with his father's spirit, and begins killing off the friends...or really Mike himself doing the killings? Who cares?  A have few troubles with this film. The first lies with Morty. thought the original made Morty look rather convincing. This time, painfully obvious Morty man (actor Jon Fedele) fake looking suit. This can especially seen early scenes, where Morty still supposed inanimate, but you watch closely you can see him blinking. Another trouble that most the characters don't try hard enough. Some them do, namely Betsy Palmer, Friday the 13th fame, who was excellent this film. But most them don't make the effort weren't given the chance. Finally, there are the killings. The opening scenes involving murders were very convincing. Actually, when saw them thought was for good movie. When the second half the movie arrives, and the killings really start, everything falls pieces. Deaths are either uncreative, unseen, foreseen (glimpses the next scene Currie has blackout). One character dies the end and one, including the viewer, even notices. While more characterization was needed the beginning half, wasn't too bad. The second half was. think new director Chris Angel got this point and really didn't know how shoot the violent scenes, they turned out real sloppy and pedestrian. silly ending doesn't help either. Thus, unless you really loved the original and enjoy plucking splinters out from under your skin, you should probably skip \"The Fear Halloween Night.\" Zanatos' score: out 10.,\n The film adaptation James Joyce's Ulysses excellent. The actors, the voice overs, the direction, all captures the feel the novel without sacrificing its own merits. The Milo O'Shea does excellent job Leopold Bloom, the cuckolded man married the sassy Molly. absolutely love this picture.,\n rated this film 7/10 which average 8/10 for screenplay, direction and 1944 production values and 6/10 for acting.My acting rating turn was calculated 4/10 for all the screen characters except for that played heroine Ella Raines Carol Richman who was excellent 8/10.Also commend Thomas Gomez Inspector Burgess whose character convinces that personally does not think the guilty verdict Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) was just view his naive alibi.These two then form alliance prove Scott's alibi.  I have this film \"Suevia Film Noir Cine Negro\" DVD Spanish \"La Dama Desconocida\" with the original soundtrack \"Ingles\" alternative language, since despite searching could not find wholly English version.I was however anxious see another performance Ella Raines after being impressed with her performance heroine \"Impact\" playing sole female garage proprietor.Here Ella performs another heroic role believing the innocence her engineer boss and refuses several suggestions that she should return her home Kansas (her boss's pet name for her) before solving the missing alibi.The fact that she secretly love with her boss little hard believe since formally just seemed have had formal business relationship with her.He had however designed children's homes and playgrounds suppose \"family man\" had lit Carol's brain.  In the 1940s with \"the film code\" operation, producers could only portray sex through metaphors and here done the form furious drumming played Elisha Cooke jnr.Carol dolls herself girl easy virtue attempt lure the drummer into giving her information about \"The Phantom Lady\" alibi.The other main character, Jack Marlow (an associate Scott Henderson) played Franchot Tone whose performance found too theatrical and wondered why Carol, for instance, did not notice him constantly and strangely admiring his hands.Here the screenplay should have been improved and provided more suspense these theatrical moves telegraphed the plot far too early the audience.,\n This \"coming age\" film deals with the experiences two young girls, Dani and Maureen, they learn about life and love one fateful summer.  Directed Robert Mulligan, famous for his superb work \"To Kill Mockingbird,\" the film never hits false note. All the acting superb. Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes stunning film debut. Watching this beautifully photographed and superbly directed and edited film, felt like was looking through window reality, rather than watching movie.  I have watched this movie least times, and can honestly say that one the single best movies ever made about being young, being love, and going through the feelings, challenges, and changes young adulthood. Families with children between and should watch together, and use discussion piece, raises number issues about sibling rivalry, how deal with being love, the responsibilities parent, etc.,\n Unfortunately the movie more concerned with making lame social commentary real event, but doesnt have the balls legitimately document what happened. The constant rhetoric how violent video games are not blame get the impression Ben Coccio avid gamer), how media and music completely devoid influence the obvious message (we even get laughable scene the two boys burning ALL their cd's, talk about subtlety!), but the movie only gets away with because its 'fiction'. Nice try. Yes its great idea relieve media influence, but how know the kids that have actually planned and executed school shooting werent influenced media? video games? dont, and wont with this movie because once again these kids are smart enough completely relinquish the media, yet dumb enough scorch nazi symbol the ground? haha somehow dont think so.  The movie bats you over the head with its portrayal the normalcy the families, its almost doing disservice think that there wasn't serious flaw the family dynamic kids that have actually gone out and shot their fellow schoolmates. Why everyone concerned with making killers seem \"normal\", when they are obviously not? completely false and phony depiction.,\n Contrary what those who hate Christianity, the 700 Club provides real answers well inspiration. also provides reliable news, logical commentary and different view than what ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS thinks best. Unlike other programs, which provide social and faith-related commentary, those who are behind the 700 Club provide help for those need, such feeding the hungry with Operation Blessing, providing medical help those living poverty-stricken communities and giving hope those who need hope. It's not all hateful. the 700 Club offends you, suggest reaching for the remote control and turning the channel your set. the same thing when find CNN Headline News for that matter, programs which find biased offensive. What find offensive the way that the ABC Family inserts the disclaimer that the views the 700 Club not reflect those ABC Family.,\n this excellent Twentieth-Century Fox film-noir, the metropolis labyrinth despair which scavengers and predators survive living off one another. Brooding cityscapes lower over puny humanity bleak expressionist symbolism.  A prostitute has her purse snatched the subway. contains microfilm, and communist spy ring will any lengths recover it. Two parallel investigations unfold both spies and cops hunt down the precious information.  Anti-hero pickpocket Skip McCoy played with scornful assurance Richard Widmark. knows the cops his moral equals and intellectual inferiors, taunts them: \"Go on,\" says captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye), \"drum charge. Throw in. You've done before.\" this pitiless world, the cops are just one more gang the streets. Just Candy the hooker bribes Lightning Louie get lead, the police are busy paying stool pigeons for information.  It hard believe that when Widmark made this film was already early middle age. The 39-year-old star, coming the end his contract with Fox, plays the upstart Skip McCoy with the irreverent brashness teenager. Today may not acceptable for the romantic lead punch his love interest into unconsciousness then revive her sloshing beer her face, but the mores the period signified toughness and Candy, after all, fallen woman.  Jean Peters radiant Candy. Here, right the middle her five-year burst B-movie fame, she beautiful and engaging the whore with the golden heart. She the story's victim, martyr her beauty much anything else. She means well, but constantly being manipulated cynical men Joey, Skip and the cops.  The real star this movie New York. Haunting urban panoramas and snidering subway stations offer claustrophobic evocation the city living, malevolent force. Like maggots rotting cheese, human figures scurry through the city's byways. Elevators, subway turnstiles, sidewalks even dumb waiter act conduits for the flow corrupt humanity. People cling any niche that affords safety: Moe has her grimy rented room, Skip his tenebrous shack the Hudson River. the characters move and interact, they are framed bridge architecture, lattices girders, are divided hanging winch tackle. The personality the city constantly imposing itself. The angles and crossbeams the wharf timbers are echo the gridiron street plan, and the card-index cabinets the squadroom mimic the Manhattan skyline. When Joey's exit from the subway barred, the steel sinews the city are ensnaring him.  A surprising proportion this film shot extreme close-up. Character drives the plot, should, and the close-ups are used augment character. When Skip interrogates Candy, the close-up captures the sexual energy between them, belying the hostility Skip's words. Jean Peters' beauty painted light, exquisite soft focus close-ups. The device also employed heighten the tension. The opening sequence, the purse snatch, contains dialogue: the drama relies entirely close-up for its powerful effect.  Snoopers, and snoopers upon snoopers, populate the film. Moe (Thelma Ritter) makes living informant, and her place the hierarchy accepted, even her victims. When Skip observes, \"she's gotta eat\", chanting recurring refrain. Just 'straight' New Yorkers peddle lamb chops lumber, the Underworld traffics the commodity information.  And yet even the stool pigeons are superior Joey and his communist friends. Joey's feet Moe's bed symbolise transgression the most basic moral code. Joey beyond the pale. Moe will not trade with Joey, even preserve her life: ... even our crummy business, you gotta draw the line somewhere.\"  \"Pick-Up\" was made the depths the Cold War. Richard Nixon had just been chosen the Republican vice-presidential candidate, having made his name with his phoney Alger Hiss expose bogus communist microfilm and all. The McCarthy show trials were daily reality. see the cops the movie inveigh against \"the traitors who gave Stalin the A-bomb\".  New York can seen giant receptacle which human offal cheats, squeals and murders. Containers form leitmotif throughout the film. Moe carries her trade mark box ties, and candy's purse, container the microfilm, the engine the plot. Skip keeps his only possessions submerged crate, symbolising his secretive street-wisdom. The paupers' coffins, moving down the Hudson barge, are containers just one more cargo being shifted around the pitiless metropolis.  The film masterpiece composition. Candy shown above the skulking Skip the rickety gangway the shack, signifying her moral ascendancy. When the gun placed the table, the extreme perspective makes look bigger than Candy violence beginning dwarf compassion. The lovers are eclipsed the shadow stevedore's hook, reminding that their love neither pure nor absolute, but contingent upon the whims the sinister city. Enyard the communist shadow wall, disembodied puff cigarette smoke. like the lone alley cat amongst the garbage predatory phantom the night. Camera shots from under taxi hoods, inside newspaper kiosks and through the bars hospital beds constantly reinforce the awareness that are all trapped the metropolis. are civilisation's mulch.,\n This was far the worst low budget horror movie have ever seen. open minded guy and always love good horror movie. fact, when I'm renting movies specifically look for some good underrated horror movies. They are always good for laugh, believe know, have seen many. But this movie was just terrible wasn't worth chuckle. was considering turning off the first five minutes... which probably should have. There nothing good about it, first and foremost, the camera crew suck3d A$$. The intro was stupid just like the ending. Acting and special effects were terrible. Please I'm begging you, NOT watch this movie, you will absolutely hate it.,\n Watching film was very light mood and also this film light but the end the film just unexpected which leaves long lasting memories one's mind.  movie starts with Abhay and his profession being witness during registrar marriage. Soha comes for marriage and his boyfriend doesn't, leaving Soha alone the street she cant back home and she don't have any thing live here this situation Abahy turns out helper for her, this the base story.  The rest just watchable and the end the story bitter sweet that Abhay has face which keeps you the edge the seat.  Dialogues and music are good songs are direction good and the screenplay you feel that movie slow but looking the demand story all right.  A truly watchable especially with light mood enjoyed this home with coke and peanuts. rating for this 8/10,\n Usually don't really like Emma Roberts much, but after watching Nancy Drew kind changed mind. The actors the movies made the whole thing exciting and funny. Most the time when you watch mystery movie you can solve before the middle the show, but this movie it's like you are actually there. The clues have all fit together until you can finally understand the whole crime. still amazed how she found out. The whole movie was really clever and the people who watched with loved the movie too. The clothes were favorite part the movie, was cute. don't think there will another movie like this until the sequel comes out. give nine because the popular girls didn't really seem have the part just right, but they still make laugh. was really great movie and great mystery. definitely recommend watching it.,\n \"Bye Bye Birdie\" isn't one the best musicals all time, but it's great fun, and accessible many audiences. The original film could have been wonderful, with Dick Van Dyke reprising his signature Broadway role, but instead they tinkered with the plot, the film very unsatisfying. This re-make, which aired ABC 1995, far more faithful the original script, and includes some original songs well that were used national tour which this film took off from which starred Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking (who choreographed this film.)  Jason Alexander very different type from Dick Van Dyke, but well cast Albert, (before his \"Seinfeld\" days, started Musical theater.) Vanessa Williams perfect fit for Rose. Their also great work from Tyne Daly Mae and Mark Kudisch Conrad Birdie role played the national tour).  This film not without it's problems though. major liability Chynna Phillips, who, however appealing, simply looks and seems too old teenage Kim. And George Wendt somewhat bland her father, somewhat throwing the number \"kids\" away number original cast member Paul Lynde stole the show with.)  But all all, this delightful, well-done film which the material deserved.,\n Although there were few rough spots and some plot lines that weren't exactly true character, this was Classic H:LOTS. The characters, outside Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito), were true form, and the reunion scenes Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were deep and well acted anything ever grace the small screen.  \"Homicide: The Movie\" aka \"Life Everlasting\" fan flick, but stands its own well any 2-hour episode the series. Fontana, Overmeyer and Yoshimura did wonderful job pulling loose ends from seasons and every major cast member \"the best damn show television\" together for the series finale that NBC never bothered give it. True \"Homicide\" form, there were happy endings, such life. That's what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie-cutter cop shows left television. Kudos the writers and the cast for creating something over the span the series and the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike.  ** call myself \"Homicidal Maniac\" for other reason than keep co-workers cooperative mood.,\n With films like \"Wallace Gromit\" and \"Chicken Run\" under their belt, the good people from the other side the pond, Aardman Animation, are now introducing bit their twisted humor the form \"Creature Comforts\".  Derived from short done early their careers, \"Creature Comforts\" slice-of-life show where snippets conversation are removed from their context and given animal some sort.  Aardman Animation went across the country interviewing people with innocuous questions such as, \"Are you liar?\" and then speed things bit asking about their sex lives.  The answers, while seeming boring and mundane, are actually quite funny, when you understand the dialogs come first and the animals are added later.  How many these animals look like the person making the statements? One the characters discussing what looks for woman, like them kind thin.\" insect, the Walking Stick.  There are two dogs discussing odors and smells, while sniffing the behind poodle, they talk about the different smells woman.  There are two birds cage. the \"wife\" tells the litany that her health, her long suffering husband stands her, saying nothing.  While might take some time for \"Creature Comforts\" find it's \"legs\", should find place television for those who are tired the ordinary. While there are more reality shows than Carter has liver pills, \"Creature Comforts\" one kind and definitely worth watching.  Some the humor might seem little racy, it's the claymation that catches the attention the children (like the old Batman series the 60's, the jokes are subtle enough the kids won't get them) and it's the jokes that are there for the adults.,\n It's the worst movie I've ever seen. The action unclear, work cameras poor, actors are affected ... and this lamentable minutes Arnie the screen. advice from the bottom heart don't watch unless you like such low class torture.,\n This film, though ostensibly comedy, deadly serious. Its subject Imperialism (with capital I): how Britain, foolishly, humiliatingly, tries convince itself that it's still great power after World War II. home, the Empire run amiable dolts, benevolent Tories who are in-bred that they can't distinguish close relatives; the Offices Government consist long forgotten archives dig Orwellian paranoia?), inhabited indolent rats, and ante-rooms wherein lounge bored synacures, reading popular novels.  Abroad, Britain clings the old pomp; but pomp out context looks threadbare and silly, especially when its embodied bumbling twits. Carlton-Browne unsentimental picture decline, with none the lachrymose rot that marred the supposedly anti-imperialist Jewel the Crown.  The film also about the Cold War, bravely admitting that it's dangerous farce, whose participants deserve mockery and contempt, not fear and respect. It's about how colonialism, characterised more neglect than tyranny, destroys the colonies deserts, robbing them amenities, power, and, most importantly, self-respect, leaving them vulnerable the machinations dangerous cowboys.  It's the seriousness, course, that kills it. That's not say that weighty subjects can't treated comedy The Miracle Morgan's Creek, Dr. Strangelove and The Life Brian have all proved that. Indeed, one might suggest that serious themes should only treated comedy allows for clearer-eyed view.  The problem with Carlton-Browne that every situation must have significance beyond the merely comic, that becomes weighed down and unfunny. the three films mentioned above, much the comedy arises from character reaction extreme situation, not the extreme situation itself. Here, the script too poor sustain rich comic characterisations, and some the greatest comedy talent ever assembled Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, Raymond Huntley and John Mesurier are criminally wasted.  Terry-Thomas, sublime often, shows that couldn't handle lead parts, and that needed play sneering, arrogant bounders, not brainless toffs. The music made carry much the comedy, but its heavy irony only draws attention the lack hilarity screen. (To fair, unlike the majority British comedies the period, which were stagy and underproduced, the Boultings often try make their points through film itself, montage and composition) Only Huntley manages raise genuine laughs, and that's essaying character could have played his sleep.  None the Boultings' farces have dated well they're never thought through enough. Although Carlton-Browne revels the decline the Empire, also seems anti-democratic and militaristic. I'm sure this wasn't intended, but these blunders are bound happen you allow worthy intentions take precedence over comic intelligence and film form.,\n When first watched this, borrowed from our local library about year ago and watched about times. We've just watched again and liked MORE than did the last time I'd watched it!! :()  The film mainly about two dogs called Charlie and Itchy (voiced Dom DeLuise and love Dom DeLuise!) Charlie half gangster and half goodie, which like. Itchy his sidekick. Charlie killed his friend (NOT) and sent heaven. When Charlie comes back life, the start amazing adventure.  The five main reasons why I'm absolutely CRAZY about this film: One: love the characters (except Carface). favourite three are Charlie, Itchy and little girl called Anne-Marie who comes slightly later. Two: love the period history which this film set. set during the prohibition the United States. Three: The Don Bluth animation (as usual) superb. The backgrounds are good too. Four: There strange excitement this film that keeps the edge seat. Five: The songs this are lovely. favourite song starts with need Brazil, the throb, the thrill\"...  So, watch this lovely film when you can, you won't disappointed! :(),\n great addition anyone's collection.  12 monkeys movie you don't see every day. has excellent actors with excellent story. This not normal role for Bruce Willis but holds the role like holds John McClane.  The virus-kills everyone earth and leaves few hundred survivors story not new one but the story takes fresh new direction it.  A man(Bruce)is sent back time get information virus which has wiped out most man kind.  The actors this were awesome. must give mention Brad Pitt who was hilarious the mental patient James Cole(Bruce) meets mental hospital.  The director did amazing job bringing disturbing picture future devastated man-made virus.  The animals seen the virus world made feel like they run the world when humans are driven into underground facilities.  This movie was excellent and must see and also its must own.  I very much highly recommend it.  10/10,\n Gayniggers from Outer Space short foreign film about black, gay aliens who explore the galaxy until they stumble upon Earth. Being gay, their goal have male-only universe which all people are gay. Hence, when they discover women \"female creatures\" live Earth, they are first terrified; eventually they decide eliminate all women the planet and liberate the male population.  An offensive title with racist, homophobic and sexist storyline, albeit probably intended satire, give this film some shock value. However, there's little substance underneath. another reviewer pointed out, there are few jokes besides the characters' names (eg. ArmInAss); think laughed once one small gay joke. think got the point the film quickly, satire bad science fiction, but after that had had enough; kept wanting the film end already (and short film!). Not brilliant particularly well-written.,\n Whenever Columbo story deviates from the familiar plot (colorful killer commits crime, Columbo smokes out killer, Columbo becomes pest the process), the writers somehow are never able match the quality and interest most traditional episodes. This episode deviates the extreme, and the result major flop. <br Would you believe: Columbo never faces the villain till the very end?!!  Frankly, was tempted turn off about two-thirds through. <br Oh, the sacrifices self-appointed reviewers make!!!,\n Riding Giants amazing movie. really shows how these people lived back then just surf. Their lives were basically surfing, living, breathing, and having fun. They didn't care about money, jobs, girls any thing. them the waves were their girls. have never been surf board, and looks hard, don't understand how they can stay them, makes sense all. This awesome movie and you love surfing then you should really see this movie. you're surfer and you want find out who started surfing, how came into life, who really famous what ever, then you should really see it. might documentary, but really good. -Tara F.-,\n Watching TRUTH ABOUT LOVE (is this double entendre about the star?) like plugging white noise manufactured water sounds help you sleep you put the DVD slot because there nothing else left the store shelves and you are need distraction after hectic day. And works for that for that purpose: being British romantic comedy bit more.  The story rather simple one about wife Alice (Jennifer Love Hewitt) married increasingly distant husband Sam (Jimi Mistry) who has put their love life hold due the burdens his busy law practice. His partner Archie (Dougray Scott) fond both Sam and Alice, but has longtime attraction Alice that goes beyond friendship. Alice pals with her sister Felicity (Kate Miles), free love advocate, who encourages Alice have affairs. Valentine's Day, after drinking binge with her sister, Alice mails card Sam signed 'Anonymous' test see Sam responds, testing his fidelity. the same time Archie mails radish seed packet Alice which has inscribed suggestive love not. Both have post facto regrets. Sam fact spending time with lover Katya (Branka Katic) and indeed cheating Alice. Alice arranges assignations with Sam via email and phone calls and plans meet Sam disguise 'Anonymous' test his fidelity. The entire cast characters gets caught the silly charade and the ending proves that real love must based truth and how that results the various pairings the surprise (of sorts) the fluffy script.  British comedies work because the quality writing and the tight quality acting. Perhaps had director John Hay elected cast British actress Alice instead pasting phony accent Jennifer Love Hewitt the result may have been improved. But the end this story Peter Bloore bounces between mildly humorous and pathetic its messages. One terrible distraction musical score that consistently loud that covers all the dialogue and intrusive. There are some nice scenes London and few moments passable humor, but the end this little film truly best utilized background music/white noise. Grady Harp,\n \"This Man's Navy\" is, other comments have indicated, rare and well-filmed look Navy lighter than air (LTA) activities. The LTA crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost ship submarine attack. And the filming the various NAS locations give valuable glimpse type aviation that long gone. However, the first half the movie all about Beery, his relationship with his service pals, and him meeting the Tom Drake character and his mother, and getting Drake's leg fixed. Only then does the second film start. The second film mostly LTAs action, taking surfaced sub, guys get killed and much damage caused. The look fairly gritty and realistic, imagine. Then shift Southeast Asia. Did the Navy have LTAs there? Never mind, this part really wild, with blimp being used extract some downed aircrew from the jungle. And the Japs are shooting like mad. Shades Vietnam, except the getaway oh, leisurely. This blimp we're talking about. the end, feel-good WWII drama about very unusual part the war.,\n wonder that the historian Ian Kershaw, author the groundbreaking Hitler biography, who originally was the scientific consultant for this film, dissociated himself from it. The film historically just too incorrect. The mistakes start right away when Hitler`s father Alois dies home, while reality died pub. the film, Hitler moves from Vienna Munich 1914, while reality actually moved Munich 1913. could endlessly. Hitler`s childhood and youth are portrayed way too short, which makes quite difficult for historically uninformed people understand the character this frustrated neurotic man. Important persons the early time the party, like Hitler`s fatherly friend Dietrich Eckart the party \"philosopher\" Alfred Rosenberg are totally missing. The characterization Ernst Hanfstaengl very problematic. the film portrayed noble character who almost despises Hitler. The script obviously follows Hanfstaengl`s own gloss over view himself which gave his biography after the war. fact, Hanfstaengl was anti-semite and was crazy about his \"Fuehrer\". But the biggest problem the film the portrayal Hitler himself. characterized someone who constantly unfriendly,has neither charisma nor charm and constantly orders everybody around. After watching the film, one wonders, how such disgusting person ever was able get any followers. Since all know, what evil criminal Hitler was, naturally every scriptwriter tempted portray Hitler totally disgusting and uncharismatic. But facts is, that private could quite charming and entertaining. His comrades didn`t follow him because constantly yelled them, but because they liked this strange man. Beyond all those historical mistakes, the film well made, the actors are first class, the location shots and the production design give believable impression the era.,\n The story and the show were good, but was really depressing and hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard great. really put top notch performance, and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous. Seriously, thought she was Carmen Electra until saw the IMDb profile. can't say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He's one favorite actors. love Anne Rice. I'm currently reading the Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad saw the movie before reading the book. This little too\"real\" for me. prefer Lestat and Louis's witty little tiffs the struggles slaves. Eartha Kitt was creepy and after her character did what she did The movie was ruined for me; could barely stand watch the rest the show. (sorry for the ambiguity, but don't want give anything away) Sorry, but it's just not type show.,\n The Shining weird example adaptation: has very little common with the source novel, written Stephen King, yet widely remembered one the best cinematic renditions the horror master's work. This due two factors: Stanley Kubrick's masterful direction and Jack Nicholson's chilly acting.  Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, writer who accepts take care the Overlook Hotel Canada during the winter period, unaffected the gruesome stories surrounding the place: claims nice, isolated location just what needs finish his new book. Therefore the Overlook becomes the new home the Torrance family: Jack, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and their five-year old son Danny (Danny Lloyd). The boy particular senses right from the beginning that something's wrong: has been told the cook, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) that endowed with mysterious psychic energy, the titular Shining, which allows people like him and Dick see flashes from the past and the future, among other things. Because this \"gift\", the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take interest Danny, even though quite capable resisting them. That not Jack's case, however, gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wife's affections and seeks comfort the company what can best defined ghosts, triggering chain insanity and dread which very hard break.  The Shining works horror movie because Kubrick, though having never worked this kind film before, knew exactly what was effective and what wasn't, hence the larger focus atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths. King criticized the director for changing most the story, omitting most the Jack/Danny subplot (merely hinted the film) that led the book's emotionally strong climax, and while his disappointment valid, the omission was actually necessary: the novel dealt with redemption, albeit unconventional way, and redemption theme Kubrick, one the most famous analysts human decay, never had soft spot for. What interested the mental, and subsequently physical, unbalance that threatens the characters, and keeps the creepy tone even thanks very cold approach and expert use the steadicam shot (Danny's encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example).  Another criticism King raised was about the actors, especially Nicholson: the writer's opinion, his trademark grin the start the movie seemed indicate Jack already was insane, thus undermining the rest the story. Now, true that Nicholson looks bit goofy from the very beginning, but equally true that Martin Sheen (King's ideal choice for the role) probably would not have been able deliver performance terrifying Nicholson's: from the moment starts grinning more unsettling way than before the immortal \"Here's Johnny!\" scene, impossible picture another actor playing that part, and even though the version The Shining from 1997 isn't bad the Torrance character indelibly linked the One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest star. for Duvall and Lloyd, both add terrific support, the latter especially deserving place alongside Harvey Stephens (The Omen's Damien) and Haley Joel Osment cinema's great horror child icons. One might complain about Duvall being completely different from the book counterpart (blonde and beautiful) and not having much else but scream and run, but two things ought considered: back 1980 the \"scream queen\" cliché wasn't one yet; rarely has any actress looked genuinely terrified camera, making the book-movie differences secondary compared the real fear that emerges from Wendy's eyes.  Irvine Welsh, the author Trainspotting, once said there such thing completely faithful adaptation any literary work (and should know, given the liberties Danny Boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought the screen), yet that doesn't mean the movie necessarily bad. The Shining proves said point perfection: very little from the novel, approximately 5%, included the film, but Kubrick and Nichlolson's hands this masterclass loose cinematic translation becomes one the finest, most original horror pictures all time, which really saying something given the genre's current poor form.,\n Yes, people are racist. People are even racist college. That's good point, and the issue racism has been dealt with many times before countless films. What sets Higher Learning apart from the pack that deals with the issue racism the most ham-fisted and predictable way possible, yeah it's college too.  This film deals with this problem racism the way Frankenstein deals with most problems, bashes you over the head repeatedly brutal and sluggish manner. Most the characters are cartoonish, one-dimensional, caricatures (lesbian feminist, angry black man), that react situations dramatically and predictably possible. Instead defying stereotypes this film overpopulated with them. The angry black men feel cheated, feminists hate men, etc. (one feminist even holds sign that reads \"Dead Men Don't Rape.\" See what mean?) don't want give anything away, but this movie someone seems like shifty loner date rapist they'll probably behave exactly how you expect them to. The changes the characters through seems obvious everyone but the people the movie. The big twist the plot hinges whether not the violent neo-Nazis will act like violent neo-Nazis. I'll guess you'll just have watch find out what happens.  Another problem have with this movie that it's supposed \"gritty\" and \"hard-hitting,\" but they make Nazis the bad guys. agree Nazis are evil, but that's point. Everybody thinks Nazis are bad; we're not breaking any new ground here. Nazis have been portrayed villains since the 1930's. The film doesn't challenge any viewpoints make bold statements. just deals with issues all know about clumsy, after-school-special like, manner. Being anti-rape, anti-racist, and anti-Nazi isn't exactly taking hard stance controversial issue.  Higher Learning predictable, cartoonish, and word stupid. Avoid all costs.,\n can't say this the worst movie ever made, but personally think that way because when was originally released theaters, (1) the initial buzz was positive enough that girlfriend insisted see it, and actually STOOD LINE get tickets, and (2) it's still the only \"serious\" film recall where the audience started snickering certain point and basically laughed the movie the rest the way through. Once reached the infamous (and interminable) snake fight scene, think everyone gave up.  The only positive can concede the lush location shooting. Oh, and there's also Bo's breasts, although her acting wooden that the nudity unerotic and doesn't rate much more than Playboy pictorial.  The \"dramatic tension\" this film between Bo's terrible acting and her husband's horrible direction. The snake fight has one the most incompetent \"action\" sequences ever filmed. However, this one those films that's bad enough, may worth watching the level unintentional humor. Definitely the worst film ever paid see.,\n Favorite part was when the credits started roll. wish could give .0000000000001 out 10. really wish had that Hour and thirty minutes back. Don't waste your money time it. really could have watched grass grow and felt better after wards.  Nadia was really pretty and hope the movie didn't destroy her career. But she chose it.  All all sucked more than any other movie has sucked. More than Kazaam and Glitter combined. That's saying something.  Don't  Do  it!!!!,\n Why watch movies like this other than have some weird misguided masochistic belief that one day will find true gem amongst all this dross can't think one one good reason. This movie was dross from start finish but semi-hilarious dross. Where else but bad Italian dubbed movie could you find heated exchanges surreal mangled English like this one between honest military type and the sinister chief secret X-files like organisation dedicated hiding \"The Truth\":  Man Black: Silence best for until are able prove that the UFOs have bellicose motives.  Military Type: any event find your interference abusive.  Man Black: Whoever has impose his will is.  I rewound the DVD (you know what mean) good half dozen times and still can't make those lines mean anything sensible. other fave line was:  \"We can quite hard those who contravert our interests.\"  It's English Jim, but not know it.   The other highlights this dull plonker movie for were the totally spaced out acting the photographer character the start. Saddled with the worst haircut EVER the history everything, the man just wandered around looking like stunned fish bad wig till kidnapped and forced look piece Plexiglas some aliens. The aliens are most effectively not seen POV shot hand held camera with fish-eye lens sort spooky the first time but, used over and over again lost its power (incidentaly, Point View shot, means the aliens always walk out rooms backwards for some reason).  The film was set \"England\". This meant the Spanish Italian set designers put some British number plates couple English cars and put Union Jack our hero's press card... and that was about it. other attempt make look like the all.  Favourite moment? When the Foley artists didn't notice that characters they were foleying (is there such word?) were longer walking gravel but were now the lawn their feet kept making loud \"crunch! crunch!\" noises. Other than that, another total waste minutes life. hope they prove those UFOs have bellicose motives soon...,\n only avoid making this type film the future. This film interesting experiment but tells cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru because touches many IMPORTANT issues but does without any discernable motive. The viewer comes away with new perspectives (unless one comes with one while one's mind wanders, will invariably during this pointless film).  One might better spend one's time staring out window tree growing. <br,\n opinion, this pretty good celebrity skit show. enjoyed seeing Greg Kinnear the host. There are many reasons why said that. Even though Hal Sparks was okay host, sometimes wish that Greg Kinnear hadn't left. you ask me, seems that nobody stays with show throughout its entire run anymore. Still, enjoyed seeing the various hosts and other people spoofing celebrities. you ask me, that was pretty darn funny. Before wrap this up, must say that kind miss this show. Now, conclusion, highly recommend this show all you die-hard sketch show fans. You will really enjoy it.,\n will never member any club that would have me,  especially this one.  Starr Andreeff single mom/stripper who gets attacked a  female vampire and left for dead. She begins get hankering for  blood, and meets with John Savage, looking like he's  wondering where left Michael Cimino's phone number. Savage  is also vampire and wants let Andreef join his little vampire  family, which consists British vamp, the blonde vamp who  attacked Starr, and green haired midget not making this  up).  The family does not want Starr, they try kill Savage and Starr  and Starr's kid.  Someone forgot tell John Savage that this was drama. He  spends most his screen time exhibiting more facial tics than  Hugh Grant Jolt Cola bender, and reads all his lines like  he making Farrelly Brothers film. Andreeff tries make the  most badly written role, but screenwriter/director Ruben goes  for all the vampire cliches, like Starr eating her son's pet hamster  and buying lot raw meat fight the craving for blood. The kid  also gets knocked around lot, for those who think watching  violence against children really entertaining.  The film extra gory, but not wild, over the top way like \"Killer  Tongue.\" Here, the gore gross and never justified, just occurs.  It just the budget. Most the rating goes Andreeff's  coworkers, who are put through embarassing strip routines the  background conversation scenes. The budget does not include  vampire fangs! All the vampires here must stab their prey eat.  Nifty idea, unless you have already seen George Romero's  \"Martin.\"  Even minutes, and once you throw Ruben's attempts at  arty direction (skewed frames, blurred scenes), this one  tiresome, dull, and dirty ride. Leave this club and take shower,  you will need it.  This rated (R) for strong physical violence, gun violence, sexual  violence, strong gore, strong profanity, female nudity, sexual  references, drug abuse, and adult situations. <br,\n This fine drama and nice change pace from today's more hectic and loud films. another solid based-on-a-true store, which still means much could made for dramatic purposes. Frankly, don't know but liked the story.  The story about young man back the Fifties who gets interested rocketry and wants enter that field instead working the coal mines everyone else, including his father, does this West Virginia town. The big problem the conflict causes between the boy and his father, which think was overdone. would like have little less tension between the two.  The young man, still boy, played Jake Gyllenhaal, one his first staring assignments, think. He's likable, are his school buddies here. It's nice see nice kids modern-day film. The two other key actors the movie are Chris Cooper (the dad) and Laura Dern (the kid's teacher who encourages him all the time.)  The cinematography decent the 1950s soundtrack fun hear. Once again: wish there more these kind films made today.,\n This movie has some beautiful sets and Albert Finney does great job the ruthless father. The movie fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh too jumpy the daughter and match whatever for Olivia Havilland's far more nuanced, mature rendering The Heiress (1949). The film's feminist-leaning conclusion also goes against the austere conclusion the novel, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, savagely parodied feminism some his other novels. fan old Hollywood and great literature, found this movie very disappointing.,\n The film begins with people Earth discovering that their rocket Mars had not been lost but was just drifting out Space near out planet. When it's retrieved, one the crew members ill, one alive and the other two are missing. What happened them told through flashback the surviving member.  While Mars, the crew was apparently attacked whole host very silly bug-eyed monsters. Oddly, while the sets were pretty good, the monsters were among the silliest have seen film. Plus, odd attempt realism, the production used process called \"Cinemagic\". Unfortunately, this wonderful innovation just made the film look pretty cheap when they were the surface Mars AND the intensity the redness practically made eyes bleed--it was THAT bad!! Despite all the cheese, the film did have somewhat interesting plot well good message about space travel. For lovers the genre, it's well worth seeing. For others, you may just find the whole thing rather silly--see for yourself and decide.  While today's standards this isn't especially good sci-fi film, compared with the films being made the time, stacks pretty well.  PS--When you watch the film, pay careful attention Dr. Tremayne. looks like the spitting image Dr. Quest from the \"Jonny Quest\" cartoon! Plus, sounds and acts lot like him, too.,\n Some gorehound-friends recommended \"Live Feed\" me, and basically can't really complain the film certainly does deliver copious amounts gross smut and buckets full sleaze, but course not very good film. More than obviously cashing the latest trend horror cinema, the so-called Torture Porn, Ryan Nicholson tries surpass every other film this sub genre (and that includes the role models \"Hostel\" and \"Saw\") with its sick twisted make-up effects and thoroughly depraved shots naked co-eds tried up, suffering and begging for their lives. There's actual plot describe. Five utterly brainless twenty-something friends take trip Asia. One them has Asian roots, but other than that don't really know why they opted travel there instead Cancun. They're clearly not interested the continents culture and even cause hectic scene when they witness local butchering cute puppy dog the market. The quintet subsequently dives into the lurid night life and one them accidentally insults the leader criminal clan. simply apology clearly doesn't suffice, the gangster follow them into adult theater and gradually subject all them vicious torture. One girl has her breast impaled and another poor wench even has poisonous snake shoved down her throat; yikes. \"Live Feed\" surprisingly boring despite all the bloodshed and the amateurish production values are quite difficult overlook, even you're used watching independent fan-boy trash cinema like this. The fat bloke depicted the cover, oriental S&M executioner, admittedly quite cool and he's also the most talented the whole bunch, because least keeps his mouth shut the entire time. wouldn't exactly recommend this pile filth, but hey, you like loud hideous metal music, nauseating torture footage and dim-witted losers, right ahead and watch!,\n say this film stinks would insulting skunks. the other commenter says, this movie insulting anyone over the mental age (it especially, incredibly insulting gays). awful and not \"so bad it's funny\" sort way either it's just plain awful. No, have say it: STINKS! (sorry skunks).  From the opening credits the end titles there hardly more than seconds this movie worth opening your eyes for. The \"plot\" incoherent, the characterization non-existent, the acting the over the top mugging \"look I'm being funny!\" school and goes on. The set pieces are clumsily set (if all) and are badly executed, it's just awful every front apart from the music maybe, don't remember thinking the music stinks (apart from the songs).  To fair the makers, they lay their cards the table pretty quickly: the opening credits include the title \"Also starring Ertha Kitt the voice Betty the meteor\" (since the meteor question turns out never never say anything but make occasional purring noise they may well have lifted Ms. Kitt's contribution from one her records) and the second line the movie runs something like: \"...and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around Uranus.\" Uranus \"Your Anus\" geddit? geddit? huh? huh?? Your Anus? The humour really that cheap.  It says strange things about the \"comedies\" that period that was perfectly permissable for the hero deliberately shoot people dead the street but not say \"sh*t\" out loud.  I paid fifty pence (about $1.00) for this movie sale. feel ripped off.,\n There are similarities between Ray Lawrence's \"Jindabyne\" and his last movie \"Lantana\" dead body and its repercussions for already dysfunctional lives. But whereas \"Lantana\" offered some hope and resolution, \"Jindabyne\" leaves everything unresolved bleak way that will leave most viewers unsatisfied, perhaps even cheated.  The storyline the aftermath fisherman's discovery corpse floating remote river based short story Raymond Carver. became element Robert Altman's classic 1993 ensemble \"Short Cuts\". Lawrence uses this theme for exploration and exposition relationships within small Australian community under stress. The movie poses some moral questions \"Would you let the discovery dead body ruin your good weekend?\" and more poignantly for Australians \"Would make any difference the dead person was aboriginal?\" The acting, especially Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, commendable. And there are elements mysticism reinforced haunting music, not unlike \"Picnic Hanging Rock\".  If all this sounds like the basis for great movie prepared for let down, the pace very slow and the murder shown near the beginning, thereby eliminating the element mystery. And are left with these desolate lives and blank finale.,\n This genuinely horrible film. The plot (such is) totally undecipherable. think has something with blackmail, but I'm not entirely certain.)  Half the dialogue consists useless cliches. The other half spoken the various actors such unintelligible imitations \"southern\" accents that (thankfully) the words cannot recognized.  But the one true tragedy the movie that such historic talent Mary Tyler Moore apparently was such dire financial personal circumstances that she appeared it. <br,\n This film travesty, and isn't fit keep company with the superior original. The plot absolute mess, and the film way too long. Everytime they're struggling, they desperately inject sentimental reminder from the first film.  \"Gregory's Girl\" one the top British films all time, this one awful.,\n While many unfortunately passed on, the ballroom scene still very much alive and carrying their legacy. Some are still very much alive and quite well, Octavia more radiant and beautiful than ever, Willi Ninja very accomplished and gives great deal support the gay community whole, Pepper Labeija just passed last year natural cause, may she rest peace. After Anji's passing Carmen became the mother the house Xtravaganza (she was the beach scene) and she looking more and more lovely well. Some balls have categories dedicated those who have passed, may they all rest peace. There currently another project underway known \"How Look?\", you can check out the website www.howdoilooknyc.org.,\n This excellent film about traditional working class family Northern England. Filmed location Bolton, stars James Mason the father who the dominant force within his home. seems. Cleverly, the film, based the play, portrays the complexities family life. The supporting cast terrific well, with many familiar faces lending support.,\n Woody Allen has made some the greatest comedies ever and would seriously consider saying that Annie Hall the greatest movie ever but really think about will probably think one two that are better, but would hard. has had course some films that aren't quite good but not that bad either like Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sweet and Lowdown but has never before had film quite bad Melinda and Melinda. Not quite tired and unfunny, his films are usually witty and hilarious but how did this happen, still our good old Woody? The plot runs around four friends who are having dinner together. Two are play writers and one the others mentions funny story that happened friend hers. about young woman who bursts dinner party unexpected. never hear the rest because the two play writes start debate whether would make better comedy tragedy. Than begin see the two points view. Both center this woman named Melinda who having trouble both with drugs and with her ex-husband. the tragedy she old family friend who after attempting suicide decided show her old best friends front door for apparent reason. The comedy about Melida who stumbles the dinner party after popping sleeping pills. Both wild whirl wind events that never really make sense fit together, make you laugh more than once twice. There are some nice performances Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell but they can't fit together there own. They cam't stop from sinking farther down than most the other films this year.,\n someone who has both read the novel and seen the film, have different take why the film was such flop. First, any comparisons between novel and film are purely superficial. They are two different animals.  The novel probably intended satire, but arrives cross between tragedy and polemic instead. Any comedic elements such those which later formed the stylistic basis the film version are merely incidental the author's uniformly cynical thrust. And lest the omnipresent white suit the author fool you into thinking this another Mark Twain, think again. more apt literary precedent would the spectre Ambrose Bierce top hat and tails. Tom Wolfe equal parts clown and hack, more celebrity than author, always looking for new grist for his self-absorbed mill.   It therefore wonder that the excellent production skills and direction lavished the making the film were doomed from the start. Unlike true satire, which translates very well into film, polemics are grounded not universally accessible observations some form other human behavior, but single-minded attack specific people whether real fictional straw men who have somehow earned the wrath the writer. Any effort create successful filmed story narrative from such beginning must have clean start, free the writer's influence interference.  Having said that, too find fault with the casting. not merely that incompetents like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith fail measure up, but that real talents like Tom Hanks, Murray Abraham, and Morgan Freeman are either totally wasted given roles that are mere caricatures.  There enough topical material here for truly great film satire, but fails come even close.,\n And children love now! Granted, can watch now and realize the animation wasn't that great, and that the plot trite. Hey, every villian introduced themselves saying ammmmm DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT\" think they might laughed at, but for young children moral story with catchy music.  Music catchy, mind you, that still had the words memorized after not seeing this film twenty years. would definitely suggest this one for younger children.,\n was having just about the worst day life. Then stumbled this cute film, watched it, and now I'm ready out kiss streetlamp.  I have admit, only watched for reasons: VERA-ELLEN'S LEGS. But it's really much more. The plot actually quite clever and creatively woven. It's almost like Shakespearean comedy with all its delightful misunderstandings. And course there's also... VERA-ELLEN'S LEGS.  The only unfortunate aspect this film that the version purchased (the \"100 Family Classics\" collection Mill Creek Entertainment) doesn't have the best video quality, and I've heard the same about the Alpha release. The brightness and contrast are bit too high, lot the scenes seem bleached out especially when Vera dancing white dress. But suppose you can fiddle with the controls your set compensate. can only imagine how looked the big screen back '51. The stage sets, costumes colours are otherwise dazzling delightfully creepy--sort \"Cabinet Dr. Caligari\" vein.  As far the romance goes, this just perfect. Not sappy, not contrived, not melodramatic. Just 100% ahhhhhh. Too bad, you poor schmucks, your miserable lives will never charming this. Har har har. Wait, what laughing at? life sucks just bad yours. hell. Time watch this movie again.,\n much like Japanese movies this one didn't just cut it... movie that supposed about rebels and the survival royal blood line turned out very slow paced movie with doubtful plot.  The photography OK, though I've seen much better sword fight scenes other Japanese movies, the fast cameras and the way they followed the characters didn't convince all. The soundtrack weak you don't even notice its presence.But worst all was the way the plot evolved.I have admit that, some times, had hard time understanding who was who and what was going on...Anyway the platonic love between the main character and another one was completely unnecessary and seemed come from Hollywood influence.  All all, your looking for action Japanese movie this isn't it. Its very slow, with very few sword fight scenes and very sentimental... bad way...,\n This movie nothing like \"Office Space\" except the premise. Office Space was hilarious. would not recommend this movie anyone, laughed not once during the entire film. Mr. Cornbluth's self-indulgent tirades quickly become more annoying than Jason Alexanders the same room. you decide see this movie, use free rental watch someone else's house you can leave necessary.,\n Uggh! really wasn't that impressed this film, though must admit that technically well made. does get for very high production values, but for entertainment values, rather poor. fact, consider this one the most overrated films the 50s. won the Oscar for Best Picture, but the film just boring times with much dancing and dancing and dancing. That's because unlike some musicals that have reasonable number songs along with strong story and acting (such MEET ST. LOUIS), this movie almost all singing and dancing. fact, this film has about the longest song and dance number history and you aren't into this, the film will quickly bore you. Give more story! result, with overblown production numbers and weak story, this film like steady diet meringue--it just doesn't satisfy the long run.   To think...this the film that beat out Streetcar Named Desire\" and Place the Sun\" for Best Picture! And, make matters worse, \"The African Queen\" and \"Ace the Hole\" weren't even nominated this category! Even more amazing that \"Ace the Hole\" lost for Best Writing, Screenplay this film--even though \"An American Paris\" had hardly any story speak and was mostly driven dance and song.,\n Evening entertaining movie with quite some depth. All the actors and actresses turn spectacular performances. With the tremendous cast, though, one expects stellar acting, but this movie the expectations are exceeded. One can relate personalities and situations ones own family. one watches the interaction the family members one's own family memories are immediately brought mind. This one the few movies that inspires one read the book. Usually the other way around; one reads the book and then wants see the movie. will definitely obtain copy the Susan Minot book and read it. The Rhode Island scenery spectacular the soundtrack. Any car buff will enjoy the apparently expertly restored period automobiles. Needless say now, but recommend Evening highly. See you will enjoy it.,\n cast 1980's movie and series guest stars (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley,Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel among several others)in the story photographer who has dreams about killing his models. course the models and other people start turning dead causing all sorts complications.  Over done not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence get rating but not enough good material engender any real interest. This best described the sort movie that gave the cable channel Cinemax the alternate name Skinamax. really can't see the point watching this unless you need see every sleazy thriller out there. also have comment that this film filled with smoking, the point that becomes laughable when anyone lights up),\n this movie had not been labeled Disney picture, probably would not have been disappointed. The nudity was unnecessary and did not add anything. The same can said for the toilet bowl scene. This one Disney film that will not let four year old nephew watch.,\n Though bit more polished technically than the previous film the series, BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES, this weaker escapade both plot that's less thrilling and leading man who simply doesn't have the charisma Ray Milland.  That said, several actors and characters continue their roles and manage keep the flag flying. Also John Barrymore present, popping all through the film variety outlandish disguises.  Anyway it's another endless night for and his cohorts chase around trying rescue the poor girl intends marry. The clues are stupid but again the supporting actors often make them entertaining.,\n Takashi Shimizu had great opportunity with remake his original film Ju-On The Grudge. While haven't seen that film, would have wager that there's more imagination and originality (or some rip-off originality, other words skill with known tropes the Japanese ghost movie) than his own directed remake. Maybe the script was written somehow have some kind warped appeal, would guess accessibility, for American audience. What starts off with some potential the hint something very screwed going with Bill Pullman's sudden movement just goes into total jumble. And horror movie? Gimme break.  Tension could have been built the situation nurse going take care disturbed woman house that haunted but undercuts everything wants get his audience feel. Scares? How's about some music timed just you know when exactly expect something. black cat? Yeah, why not just make the ghost-boy thing sound like cat for creepiness which, effect, only creepy you want cats. Plot? Why not just shuffle between past and present without any semblance actual flow how story could told (meaning, while the flashbacks are inserted and are meant organic with the story overall, they aren't), for that matter have care about ANYONE the cast.  By the time the characters, those that are there for exposition, get around telling what going whatever, there's little point care. The film-making shoddy (i.e. the 180 degree rule broken many times over and not forgivable intriguing way), and the performances are wooden even when looking frightened shocked (Gellar especially disappointing, but Pullman, who shows later after his first scene, sorely miscast). Even when Shimizu tries for some average old \"Boo\" scares, like when the woman the office building and chased the Grudge ghost, it's still silly. Just watch when she's going that elevator and the ghost the background shots. Either you'll with it, and more power you, you'll laugh hysterically the results. Count the latter.  I'm not totally sure where this project went wrong was Shimizu having retool for the studios, him not giving enough leeway with his revamp his vision? maybe Raimi had some say and made things more confusing and/or dull than they would with someone else. The Grudge gives lot information that doesn't make sense the least give some horror-fodder chew on. It's cineplex trash sad order.,\n Thats Bush first all very entertaining show Parker and Stone, thought. Its often very very funny, and its quite subversive and crazy. South Park fans would surely get something here.   Another surprise the production value here. lot money must have been put into this, and shows. lot expensive little details. Its not little show. And Comedy Central not extremely rich channel, but they put lot into this show obviously. way understand that was the death the show well though, too costy. surely could have been done cheaper and went the will was there.   The critics liked it, and had its little fanbase, but failed gaining big audience. know, the show stopped after episodes, which guess almost season.   As really liked the show has its faults. The problem the show kind that doesn't know what wants really. Its like tries sitcom AND parody sitcom the same time. The actors good job, and some them are well casted, but opinion they seem not always get 100% the bizarre humor they're supposed present.   I personally think that the show needed some characters that were more down earth for the show work. South Park you have Kyle and Stan, that are kind realistic touch the more looney universe. think thats kind what makes South Park work. You need some sane characters that you can relate realistic way, and that makes the insane stuff much more interesting too because that forces you take them seriously some level. everything archetypes and stereotypes its difficult get emotionally included the show, which really Thats Bush biggest problem. Kyle and Stan characters South Park that makes sense the insanity the show. have nothing like that here, and this show suffers from it.   Another anchorpoint Parker and Stones flirting with republicans. Its the only thing about them don't really get what they're trying do. Not portraying Bush nothing else than dumb Homer Simpsons lovable kind character kind subversive world where lot people that can't stand him and think he's the worst president since Nixon, and parallel comedy world Letterman and that only satirizes his every move... but its difficult understand Parker and Stone actually means anything it. Its like the joke us, but somehow doesn't hit the mark. seems awkward, because doesn't remind you the real Bush all.   Besides that actually thought the show was very enjoyable. Some the jokes here are hilarious. The pro-life supporter who was surviving aborted fetus probably one favorite jokes them any show. And the show packed with great material, and sometimes insanely funny you use your head little while watching it.,\n It's hard for criticize anything that Mitzi Kapture does. She just radiates beauty and grace the screen and phenomenal actress. That notwithstanding, yes, the plot was predictable. think perhaps Jill HAD slept with Richard then may have made him little crazier than already was, which would have added more the suspense. would have also been nice see Jill and her husband find out about Richard's little problem with his ex-wife, maybe bit more back story. was little disappointed with the ending the movie. would have liked have seen more closure with Zack's death and possibly closure with her husband. have say though, will never able look flare gun and not picture her standing there. was very fitting end for Richard. course, Mitzi ROCKED! looking forward her future projects.,\n This DVD appears targetted someone who will just put and play endless loop the background. It's organized series music videos the Grand Canyon set various pieces Tangerine Dream music.  Unfortunately, the music dull, and the transfer DVD looks rather blurry and dim. Too expensive DVD for what is.,\n Andy Goldsworthy taoist master the first order, expressing the Way through his sublime ephemeral art. Indeed, time and change what his work fundamentally about. bought his first book several years ago and family has marveled many times. was treat get know the artist personally through this film, just patient and gentle you would expect, and has some wonderful things say about the natural world, the deepest which are expressed his occasional inability say words all. like most children who play the great outdoors alone (if they anymore), creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they outgrow it. Mr. Goldsworthy was given the gift and the mission extend that sort play create profound visions nature, and open our often weary eyes brilliant new ways. And always with the utmost respect, gratitude and humor wandering, and wondering monk.,\n the sequel the brilliant Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, Bill and Ted are under threat from the future, the evil Chuck Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised Bill and Ted earth kill human Bill and Ted, order change the future.  In great comedy pairing, Winter and Reeves excel deliver delicious humour the audience this entertaining sequel. Though lacking the sharpness the first, Bogus Journey still has the great catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair, not mention hilarious performance William Sadler, who brings humorous side the figure depth, the grim reaper. Watch for the games sequences, the best moment the entire film, but one many great techniques used justify the genre.  Though still packed with humour, this film has more dramatic film towards it, with stakes being more serious and situations more risky.   This gives the film great dimension and another lovable feature. The creators also stretch the boundaries the fantasy genre and the use realism, with hell and heaven being heavily symbolic and present the plot. The fantasy genre again spot with the use that amazing time travelling machine, though again somewhat confusing points with the use timing, and objects and situations being placed before happens the present, evident the final couple scenes.  The first watch hated this sequel, but the second time was real joy appreciated the jokes and story more, and though the jokes and plot aren't strong its predecessor, Bogus Journey has enough feel good motives, jokes and fairly steady plot make good natured family film.,\n And gave high 7.....  Why? Because bloody well rocked. the time when there were many OTHER shows that were tied toys/games this show was unique that had overlapping stories. others have said here was ahead its time.   Sadly this why the show was doomed. They have released DVDs with episodes the series far. hoping that more come out.   How does this compare watching now years after first came out.. don't know still like despite the sometimes clunky animation, and that IMHO it's only flaw. The writing was almost top notch and way ahead the competition........   I hope for more DVDs even set all the episodes proper order... The DVDs are good but don't think the stories are their proper order, but despite this the show rocked.,\n figured the whole joke the movie would see some rich white guy acting like Chris Rock, and then see Chris Rock react people's reactions. Instead you just see Chris Rock being himself and people not understanding him. There are maybe scenes the entire movie where they use their gimmick. This should have been lot better.,\n Some people say this the best film that PRC ever released, I'm not too sure about that since have fond place heart for some their mysteries. will say that this probably one the most unique films they, any other studio, major minor, ever released.  The plot simple. The ghost wrongly executed ferryman has returned the swamp kill all those who lynched him well all their off spring. Into this mix comes the granddaughter one ghosts victims, the current ferryman. She takes over the ferry business the ghost closes the man she loves.  Shrouded dense fog and set primarily the single swamp set this more musical poem than regular feature film.Listen the rhythms the dialog, especially the early scenes, their poetical cadence them. Likewise there similar cadence the camera work travels back and forth across the swamp crossing back and forth across the door way between life and death, innocence and guilt. The film reminds opera oratorio musical object lesson more than normal horror film. Its amazing piece film making that probably unique film history.  This isn't guild the Lilly. This low budget horror/mystery that tells you neat little story that will keep you entertained. Its tale love and revenge what matters here, not the poetical film making and holds you attention first and foremost (the technical aspects just being window dressing.) there any real flaw its the cheapness the production. The fog does create mood but also hides the fact that this swamp entirely dry land. The constant back and forth across okay for while but even after minutes you wish that could see something else.  Don't get wrong like the film great deal. Its good little film that some how wish was slightly less poverty stricken. Its definitely worth look you can come across it.,\n The world terrible place. But this movie farce and it's fun. And you don't like it... you don't get it... and you don't get... doesn't matter. It's you you want play along. Every actor this one had fun. It's only joke. And that's good enough for me. Gabriel Byrne priceless. Byrne and Paul Anka doing WAY is, \"Vic\" puts it, \"...the best version ever\". Okay... it's masterpiece, but it's not bad. was warned against seeing it, but I'm sure glad did...,\n Don't waste your time this dreck. portrayed, the characters have redeeming values and watching them interact sheer torture. \"Gothic\" was entertainment least, this crap. you like watching pretentious and spoiled poets straining outwit each other, this may right your alley. Lord Byron portrayed complete jerk, and why the others would choose spend more than five minutes with him truly bewildering. Mary Shelly appears the only character with any spine whatsoever, but even she comes out the whole ordeal without ounce respect. What waste time. See Gothic instead. also remember seeing another superior movie based the same subject matter, but didn't catch the title. was hoping this was it, but such luck. Not recommended.,\n will never forget the night saw this movie. were submarine patrol the North Atlantic and this was the scheduled movie the evening. ALL gave after the second reel. They did not even try show the mid-night showing. Opting for rerun instead...... This all really have say but they have this stupid rule that comment must contain ten lines. I'm not supposed pad the comment with random words will just continue ramble until get ten lines BS. could not find George Goble listed the credits but remember him the movie. The sining was terrible and the songs even worse.,\n Not really big box office draw, but was pleasently surprised  with this movie. James did some things Farrah Fawcett\" Orr   co-wrote and directed this movie about ordinary, average guy  named Larry Burrows who thinks his life would have been  incredibly different hit homerun key baseball game  when was 15. But thanks mysterious and magical bartender  Mike, Larry gets his wish, yet soon realizes that his new life  isn't exactly hoped would be.  I must say, this movie really impressed me. Critics have given  it mixed, and must say the concept really interesting and  pulled off well. Yes, little standard, but packs enough  funny moments, drama and excellent acting make really  good. James Belushi think) was Oscar worthy for his role. Jon  Lovitz perfect, and Linda Hamilton plus Renee Russo shine in  their roles. Michael Caine perfect the bartender. It's  just good movie with good lesson. you've never seen, I  highly recommend you check,\n This Jackie Chan's best film, and personal favourite. After the disappointing U.S made 'The Protector' directed James Glickenhaus, Jackie took the concept and placed slap bang into Hong Kong. This also probably Jackies most violent movie, with the audience cringing the bone breaking stunts.  The action fast and furious, Jackie and his crew really did put max effort into the fight design. Bones were broken and blood spilt the process making this film you'll see the credits.  The script simple cops and robbers affair, nothing special, after all was written around the action. must say that the english version has some dodgy dubbing, but shouldn't put you off too much.  So, get the lads round, crack open the beers and enjoy. the way, the film was nicknamed 'Glass Story' the stunt crew. Why? I'll let you find out for yourself!!,\n watched this film the Hallmark Channel recently. opinion, the film started out decent enough, but eventually got sour.  The Story: U.S. soldier Afghanistan receives one the Christmas cards that woman back the U.S. has sent out troops for Christmas. becomes inspired the Christmas card that feels has given him ray hope and happiness his life, motivation continue on. When given leave, goes the very town that the woman lives in. comes across and spunky young woman and eventually finds out that she the one that sent the Christmas card. meets the family and after saving her dad Vietnam War Veteran) from getting hit car whilst crossing the street, the family decides take him for while. learn that doesn't have family back home. The soldier agrees help out the family during the Christmas season working with them their logging company. The family comes love him and vice-versa. The soldier also becomes love with the family's daughter the woman that sent the Christmas card. There's only one problem. She already has serious relationship with man that she's love with. It's also long distance relationship. The boyfriend very different from the soldier. prefers wine and trips France over hard labor and the great outdoors. The woman prefers the latter. Throughout the rest the film, there \"love triangle\" the woman's boyfriend back town visiting her for the season. Everyone the family seems want the daughter with the soldier and the mom basically wants what's best for her daughter. **(SPOILER ALERT)** The woman comes like the soldier more and more, they have lot common. They happen spend lot time together. She gradually becomes attracted his persona. Then one day kisses her and and she kisses him back. Now she's confused! She's love with her boyfriend and wants marry him someday, but she's become fond the soldier. Soon enough, the boyfriend (who doesn't know about the kiss, but very protective the woman and thinks the soldier has been trying move her) decides propose the woman and she accepts. His plans for their marriage, however, are not plans that she wants. She wants home, have kids and close her family. wants travel the world, exotic places and they have kids wants take them along. This doesn't sound too thrilling for the woman. However, the soldier feels bad about what he's done and doesn't want make things worse. So, decides leave town, despite the dad's urging him stay and with his daughter. all comes head when, the Christmas Eve service with Church, find out that the soldier hasn't left yet. The boyfriend and the woman speak each other outside and he, broken-hearted, basically decides let her and breaks with her. The film ends with the woman and the soldier getting together.  Things like: like the soldier throughout much the film. He's basically nice and polite, with strong sense doing good for others; there are moments which the family going with Church and participating charitable causes; the family hold hands and pray during evening meal the table; the dad and mom have long-lasting and evidently healthy marriage; the soldier tries the right thing situation after did something very wrong   Things don't like: There very typical \"love triangle\" story this film; the soldier turns sour slowly and subtly moves the woman and then eventually kisses her when she already has boyfriend; most the family practically applauds this behavior the family goes with Church and participates services, yet this how they act; there some bad language   Conclusion: became disappointed the film ran on, and got worse and worse. ended fast forwarding the very end the film because had enough. So, the film started out decent with some few gem moments, but ended ruining itself. Therefore, don't recommend this film anyone.,\n Here's the kind love story that enjoy watching. And mostly, it's for two reasons. One, concentrates young people, VERY young people. People who are still their teens and are experiencing love for the first time, least think they are. All have been there our lives and \"The Man the Moon\" magnificent reflection upon our memories, maybe adding few more details and enhancing further than any have experienced. The second reason that love triangle. And believe that teens, it's the most dramatic. And the story well developed that you believe the characters could really love, are just new love that they just strongly believe they are and after tragedy occurs, will believe for the rest their lives.  The cast \"The Man the Moon\" full great talented names. stars Sam Waterston, who truly versatile actor, well capable playing tough district attorneys well strict, yet caring and wise fathers this film. Also there Tess Harper, Jason London, and young, young Reese Witherspoon. You look the young, talented actress she age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road, she's going win the Academy Award. All members the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue the compelling screenplay, they are enhanced into looking like real people real situations. all really happened. This the kind movie that would like see come out more often. Love story not. would love see films that make everything look real and not phony disbelievable any way.,\n This interesting left turn for Reel Indies. TWO HARBORS B&W minute film from Minnesota that features non-actors and about two people finding connection through search for alien life. applaud the boldness the Reel programmers thinking out-of-the-box when selecting this film. just wish they had picked stronger film bold with. matter fact, wonder the choice had more with the uniqueness the film than with the actual quality the film itself (Not that TWO HARBORS completely without merit, but I'll get that little later).   As common with independent films, TWO HARBORS limited terms location. There are only two real locations large junk dealership market and very teeny trailer, which the home the middle-aged main character, Vic, played Alex Cole. Writer/director James Vculek uses the market setting provide exposition about Vic, who one the dealers there. has various people walk Vic and start very long conversations that provides with just two pieces information Vic sells space toys (he prefers call them \"outer space action figures\") and caustic asshole. This emblematic one the two key problems with TWO HARBORS all the chatting. I've said before and I'll say again are dealing with visual medium and filmmakers need work harder tell their stories visually. There are exceptions, course, but generally, endless patter not engaging film particularly the dialogue being used exposition. Pretty much all the conversations the film are long and unnecessarily verbose. notable example would few scenes which feature Vic trying play himself off Boy Scout leader order get discount store. argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes don't even advance the plot one iota. This the kind thing that makes even minute film feel long.  The other problem with TWO HARBORS the acting. may bit curmudgeon when comes performance film, but really don't feel like there's good excuse for not having good actors your films. There are plenty good actors out there, many which willing work low-budget projects even Minnesota. Many filmmakers eschew the importance acting ability being secondary their visuals, but that naïve. narrative film-making, next the story, nothing more important than the acting/performances. you don't believe the people enacting your story, your audience lost.  Originally, thought Vculek was using non-actors, but the film went on, decided that they were probably community theater-type actors. wasn't that they were uncomfortable camera. It's that they were overly theatrical (i.e. big). Granted, the best the actors were the two leads Cole and Catherine Johnson Cassie, lonely young girl that gets caught Vic's extra-terrestrial hunt. They seemed have the most training, but they were still little rough around the edges. The eccentricities they displayed seemed surface only not coming from real, organic place within. Ms. Johnson, particular, interesting case. She definitely has presence Midwestern charm about her, but that charisma belies the multitude issues her character supposed have. She struggles portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from supposed life solitude and (slave?) labor, relying stock gestures like eye rolls, lip biting and stammering suggest her discomfort with the outside world.  I mentioned the first paragraph that TWO HARBORS not completely without merit and here's what mean. Without giving too much away, there fade white hour into the film. After that, the story takes stunning turn, which allows the last fifteen minutes evocative and downright powerful it's like sucker punch the gut, but good way. It's almost huge relief feel something after long with these characters. The last five minutes the film don't have any dialogue all and the result the best part the film subtle, detailed (Cole does his best work the film) and most importantly, cinematic. Then, with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation all that it's based true story, which got thinking. With all the dialogue, the minimal locations and the lack cinematic qualities, occurred that with two kick ass actors and tightening re-write, TWO HARBORS might make really kick-ass stage play maybe even one-act. there are any bold theater producers out there reading this, definitely recommend seeing you can get hold the film and contact the filmmaker, Reel whomever. There might something this story after all   (For more information this any other Reel film, check out their website www.reel13.org),\n Oh, this such glorious musical. There's bit miscasting Frank Sinatra sorely miscast the Jewish Nathan Detroit, though only becomes evident \"Sue Me\", which distinctly Jewish song. Sadly, the filmmakers decided cut out one the best songs from the show, \"Marry the Man Today\", and replaced with inferior Sinatra showpiece. With these two flaws mind, the movie otherwise magnificent. Jean Simmons shines Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando can't sing worth beans, but pulls off anyway. Stubby Kaye wonderfully reprises his Broadway role (it was written for him). Damon Runyon's language and pacing and humor come through quite well. This see-it-every-chance-I-get list.,\n rented this thinking might interesting, and might have been interesting story except that was told such uninteresting manner. Hard follow, strange editing, disjointed storyline, the characters mumble, all all dreadfully dull waste time. just couldn't get into and didn't care what happened the characters not even Ian Holm could save this film. Unless you need cure for insomnia, I'd skip it. 3/10, and that's being generous.,\n you are wondering where many the conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about the the UN, Israel, and international affairs come from, look further.  This isn't supernatural Hollywood film loosely based some biblical passage. Instead, this movie was made company (Cloud Ten Pictures) with political and religious agenda. movie, the end result times more looks like clips out televangelism program (complete with family prayers and light breaking through church windows while harps are playing).  For mainstream viewers, may hard believe, but many people believe this stuff literally, presented the movie. And that, perhaps, makes the movie important. You probably won't find more concise exposition the bizarre views significant number your fellow citizens. So, you view it, view social/cultural document. you are all media savvy, you don't need warned about the unsubtle attempts propaganda and manipulation the movie.,\n \"Citizen the superbly told true story the hunt for one history's worst serial killers. What makes this story even more compelling where and when took place; the Soviet Union the 1980's.  ** Mild Spoilers ** <br Viktor Burakov (magnificently played Stephen Rea) newly promoted forensic investigator for the Rostov oblast militia. discovers past and present unsolved murders, apparently the same person. The murders are unsolved because one has ever taken the trouble properly investigate the evidence. driven find and stop the killer. His only tools are his dedication, skill and honesty. His obstacles are the corruption and political ideology the Soviet system that discourages the search for truth. His naiveté would have led failure were not for his boss, Col. Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland). Fetisov politically astute cynic who understands the game and knows how deal with the Soviet bureaucracy. However, also shares Burakov's desire bring murderer justice, even the official party line \"There are serial killers the Soviet Union!\" <br The cast outstanding. The locations and sets are perfect recreations latter day Soviet life. Randy Edelman's score particularly good. <br More important, this film shows dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon with both intensity and poignancy. This was made-for-cable movie HBO Films and they have become great resource for films that would otherwise never made.,\n When Stanwyck's husband-to-be murdered the eve their wedding, she retreats mountain lodge, where she slips (sort of) off cliff and rescued wealthy attorney Morgan. Morgan falls love with her, leading definitely one-sided marriage, spent huge estate Chicago (which appears surrounded mountains!). Stanwyck tempted dashing Cortez, but eventually returns Morgan, very subdued and unconvincing story resolution.  This film has great cast (Morgan particular one favorites) and great director, but the script meandering and seems pointless times. was ready enjoy this movie but was ultimately disappointed. Still worth watching for the cast, and it's good for anyone who likes 1930s films.,\n I've seen this movie more than once. was par with lot the spooky stuff that was being shown television movies back then. The only problem had was with the title for the obvious reasons... One immediately thinks the famous snack cake Drake's! Leaving off the first part, 'Hound Hell' would have sufficed.  Richard Crenna always manages bring sense seriousness anything does, anyway whether the plot good bad. But this was enjoyable Halloween fare offered the CBS network. loved the part where Crenna takes flight some obscure country find the mystic who would help him conquer the evil beast. asks the cab driver how find this guy. Great dialogue between the native cab driver and Crenna terms the cabby dissing his own people's ethnic beliefs. 'Aw, Mr. Barry, left that stuff behind when came down from the mountains...' referring the mystic who rarely sees advises people, and nobody knows how really contact him.   As far supernatural fare goes, this movie still enjoyable.,\n found Darkness just too DARK. had kind cool idea and some ambitious ideas, not bad action scenes and few splashy moments make you UGH! BUT, was underlit the point confusion. You don't really know what always going the dark scenes and for film that shot Super Film, you already have all that nasty grain deal with. with Nathan Schiff movies, it's just too much. Director Leif Jonker seems want make original film, but lacks the know-how it. The camera never pointed the right place, lack fundamentals such how shoot simple dialogue scenes and how light movie hurt well. The actors are all pretty uneven and hammy. But despite these negatives, the music good, the gore plenty and ranges from silly putty really good appliances. this classic like says? worthy the two discs worth praise? NO. But good first try. Now these guys would stop patting themselves the back about this movie (from what understand here the only one they have ever finished) for while and try again, they may better.,\n While movie titles contains the word 'Mother', the first thing that comes our mind will mother's love for her children.  However, The Mother tells different story.  The Mother not discuss the love between mother and her child, how she sacrifice herself for the benefit her child. Here, Notting Hill director Roger Michell tells how mother's love for man about half her age hurts the people around her.  Before Daniel Craig takes the role James Bond, here, plays Darren, man who helping renovate the house the son the mother, and sleeping with her daughter well. Anne Reid, who was familiar face series, takes the challenging role the leading character, May.  The story begins with May coping with the sudden loss her husband, Toots, family visit her son, Bobby. While she befriends Darren, handyman who doing some renovation Bobby's house, she was shocked found out that her daughter, Paula, was sleeping with Darren. the same time, May was coping with life after the death Toots. Fearing that Harry and Paula not wanted her, May starts find her life going off track, until she spends her afternoon with Darren.  Darren was nice and friendly May, and May soon finds some affection Darren. Instead treating him like friend, she treated the man who was about half her age with love couple. Later, May found sexual pleasure from Darren, where gave her the pleasure she could never find anyone else. And this the beginning the disaster that could lead the break down family.  The Mother explores the inner world widow who wanted try something she never had her life, and solace someone who there for her shoulder on. This can told from May buying tea time snacks for Darren fulfilling sexual needs from man younger than her, where eventually gave her more than she bargained for.  Anne Reid has made breakthrough for her role May, she was previously best well known for her various role series. she not have much movies her career resume, The Mother has put her the critic's attention. Daniel Craig, the other hand, had took similar role his movie career, such Sylvia (2003) and Enduring Love (2004). his reprising role James Bond fails, film reviewers should not forget that has better performance small productions his years movie career, and The Mother one them.  The Mother may not everyone's favorite, but definitely not your usual matinée show along with tea and scones, accompanied butter and jam.,\n just can't believe that these games can get much better, but they do. Unfortunately had rent Dreamcast play it, but even though did beat can't wait buy for PS2. This the only series games that must own all them even have beaten them many times over. hope they never stop making this type game even the series must come end. <br,\n generally don't give worry much about violence films, vast amount philosophy, symbolism psychology. All this very well with and the film brings lot the above us. There beautiful pictures especially the lake and the nature, good setting characters, good direction. This film could voted for good film. However, spoiled for two reasons and both these reasons relation make this film simply disgusting.  First all there violence used against living creatures make this film. Not movie violence, talking about REAL violence. This violence alone maybe could justified not and thats reason number two; the message the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women. Not that all don't have some real twists with women.(respectively men). But the conclusion the film ruins all.   *spoiler* Our \"heroine\" finally dies, (by here own hand remember correctly saw this film years ago and enraged me, now the guy out with new film witch certainly not going watch)and now even more clearly depicted some kind natural demon, nature growing over her, particular her sex.. course the director who \"kills\" the women heroine. Women have die, especially men are attracted their sexuality. That seems the final conclusion.**end spoiler*  Well, well all that possibly would fine with the director would have kept his view himself. But use big pictures, artsy directions cruelty living creatures, just say men can frightened women, and men are cruel women. Thats just not enough. knew when saw this film would achieve good critics for the \"philosophical, eastern and artistic\" and whatever approach. But this film just totally marred.,\n This movie truly one the worst pieces garbage ever. really surprising that something completely terrible could made. But, you can stand the mind-numbing plot, character development, and direction, you may get kick out the soundtrack which appalling that funny. The movie begins terribly and quickly becomes unwatchable. Someone should give anyone involved with this movie some sort consolation because their career was probably ruined because involvement this movie. you end seeing this movie have seen already feel your pain) then these words have come too late. For anyone else, Stay away all costs realize that the movie bad that will waste hours your life. Then least you can clean something while viewing it.,\n Aim For The Top! Gunbuster one those anime series which has classic written all over it. totally loved this series, and this day, remains favorite anime. And while was not Gainax's first animated product, was their first OVA series.  Mainly starting out parody the 1970's sports drama Aim For The Ace (Ace Nerae!), Gunbuster picks steam serious drama toward the ending episode when Noriko Takaya forced relive the death her father, who was killed mankind's initial encounter with the insect race Humanity war with. because her father's death that Noriko wants become combat pilot. But her lack confidence proves get the way times and she falters. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, even has doubts about Noriko being chosen pilot. However, Noriko's coach, Koichiro Ota, has faith her. And has made his personal mission see that she succeeds becoming pilot, for was survivor the battle which Noriko's father was killed.  Other characters include Jung-Freud, Russian combat pilot assigned serve with the squadron Noriko and Kazumi belong to, Smith Toren, love interest for Noriko who killed their first sortie together, and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's childhood friend. Kimiko's involvement also interest, while Noriko off space, Kimiko remains behind Earth live normal life. And because the acts time dilation, Kimiko ages normally Earth while Noriko relatively the same age when she left school. the end the series, Noriko roughly years old while Kimiko her mid-fifties.  All all, this excellent anime series watch you are fan giant robot mecha and Gainax animation. you like Hideaki Anno's other shows, are fan Haruhiko Mikimoto's artwork, then give this show chance. will grow you.,\n first flicked onto the LoG accidentally one night while waching television: since then, have never missed episode.  It's humour very weird, like cross between Brass Eye's social commentary, the Fast Show's excellent one-liners, and amazing plot that seems develop each week without ever going anywhere. The best example this was Hillary Briss's special stuff what was that all about?  The humour will not appeal all. Some will say it's just too sick, and it's easy see where they're coming from. Nonetheless, give try. you don't like it, don't watch it, but you like you'll very glad you took advice.,\n No, this nothing about that fairy tale with the pumpkin coach, fairy godmother and the glass slippers, but were elaborate, would have spoil for you, which won't. But don't let curiosity get the better you, this movie not fantastic. It's one those movies that start off promisingly, before betraying its audience with cheap scare tactics and incoherent storyline. And that's real horror.  Yoon-hee (To Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mother and daughter. One's successful plastic surgeon, while the other your dutiful, obedient, and beautiful teenage daughter. Their relationship like hand glove, close you'd think them more siblings rather than parent-child. But things start wrong (don't they always) when Hyun-soo's friends, whom Yoon-hee has operated on, start berserk.  Perhaps it's warning audiences, and for those Koreans ladies who don't bat eyelid when going under the knife, news reports are believed. The only truly scary moments are those scenes plastic surgery, though somehow, thought Kim Ki-duk's Time actually had more gore when featuring and describing what goes during the surgery itself.  It's tale two halves, the fist being attempt shock audiences with standard scare tactics, which, admit, did get now and then. However, the second half degenerated the movie into mindless mumbo-jumbo melodramatics, and was quite contrived into its forcing its ideas down your throat. Some things begin not make sense, and while attempts are always presented explain, you probably won't buy it, not that horror movies are logical begin with.  The leads are all beautiful, and there distinct lack male presence besides the negligible cop role. But hey, I'm not complaining, though the storyline could have been improved tremendously. I'd recommend you watch this, only you're fan mediocre Korean horror, VCD. Watch out for those face off-ish moments!,\n Worry not, Disney fans--this special edition DVD the beloved Cinderella won't turn into pumpkin the strike midnight. One the most enduring animated films all time, the Disney-fide adaptation the gory Brothers Grimm fairy tale became classic its own right, thanks some memorable tunes (including Dream Wish Your Heart Makes,\" \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,\" and the title song) and some endearingly cute comic relief. The famous slipper (click for larger image) all know the story--the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply won't have it, this uppity Cinderella thinking she's going ball designed find the handsome prince appropriate sweetheart, but perseverance, animal buddies, and well-timed entrance fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right. There are few striking sequences pure animation--for example, Cinderella reflected bubbles drifting through the air--and the design rich and evocative throughout. It's simple story padded here agreeably with comic business, particularly Cinderella's rodent pals (dressed conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks another famous Disney heroine) and their misadventures with wretched cat named Lucifer. There's also much harrumphing and exposition spouting the King and the Grand Duke. It's much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films today, which makes simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying.,\n Caught this movie the tube Sunday. thought was bad looked IMDb see what others thought it. was not surprised the amount silly people who enjoyed this fluff. was however surprised when looked into the comments read the Hated categories only find that their were none. was shocked this; always look the hated it's their are always those who hate movie matter how good is. Somehow this movie made through unscathed the haters say nay that and proclaim proudly that HATE THIS MOVIE! know should into detail about why hate this movie but would only grant this movie more respect than deserves.,\n Alan Rudolph so-so director, without that special touch. example, there was one shot The Secret Lives Dentists the dental office which could have expressed the entire relationship between the husband and wife. Rudolph squandered it. The camera the hallway looking through the doorways the two dental offices, with Dana and Dave each alone their respective rooms. You get the idea their desolation and isolation, but not much more. The lighting, the colors, the body language, the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved upon. were directing, would have spent all day, necessary, get that shot right. That's the beauty and power film: can express much, whole lives, matter seconds  The shot with the toddler stepping the puddle puke could have been improved on. The child should have shown more fascination with the puddle, should have stomped and shuffled her feet, should have had her head bent down look the puddle with all her attention.   Campbell didn't deliver. plays uncommunicative man, true, but instead conveying his inner turmoil voice, gesture, body movement, the film relies voice-over narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter-ego, played Denis Leary.,\n It's not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope would based the acclaim garnered, but 1969's \"Midnight Cowboy\" still powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view the time. Directed John Schlesinger and written Waldo Salt, the movie seems product its time, the late 1960's when American films were especially expressionistic, but still casts spell because the story comes down themes loneliness and bonding that resonate matter what period. The film's cinematic influence can still felt the unspoken emotionalism found Ang Lee's \"Brokeback Mountain\".  The meandering plot follows Joe Buck, naive, young Texan who decides move Manhattan become stud-for-hire for rich women. Full energy but lacking any savvy, fails miserably but unwilling concede defeat despite his dwindling finances. meets cynical, sickly petty thief named \"Ratso\" Rizzo, who first sees Joe easy pawn. The two become dependent one another, and Rizzo begins manage Joe. Things come head psychedelic, drug-infested party where Joe finally lands paying client. Meanwhile, Rizzo becomes sicker, and the two set off for Florida seek better life. This not story that will appeal everyone, fact, some may still find repellent that hustler and thief are turned into sympathetic figures, yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic.  In his first major role, Jon Voight ideally cast brings out Joe's paper-thin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities. Rizzo, Dustin Hoffman successfully upends his clean, post-college image from \"The Graduate\" and immerses himself the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act oddly compatible counterpoint Joe. The honesty their portrayals complemented Schlesinger's film treatment which vividly captures the squalor the Times Square district the time. The director also effectively inserts montages flashbacks and fantasy sequences fill the character's fragile psyches. Credit also needs Salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos the story. The other performances are merely incidental the journeys the main characters, including Brenda Vaccaro the woman Joe meets the party, Sylvia Miles blowsy matron, John McGiver religious zealot and Barnard Hughes lonely out-of-towner.  The two-disc 2006 DVD package contains pristine print transfer the 1994 restoration and informative commentary from producer Jerome Hellman since unfortunately neither Schlesinger nor Salt are still living. There are three terrific featurettes the second disc look-back documentary, \"After Midnight: Reflections Classic Years Later\", which features comments from Hellman, Hoffman, Voight and others, well clips and related archive footage such Voight's screen test; \"Controversy and Acclaim\", which examines the genesis the movie's initial 'X' rating and public response the film; and tribute the director, \"Celebrating Schlesinger\".,\n liked this show lot got the first and only, would appear, series the channel The characterisation was right the money bit like the Simpsons that all the different facets small town populace were represented.  There was laughter track hadn't seen this American comedy the time except for Larry Sanders and really worked well here, heightening the suggestion that these wacky cops were really like that, and not just hamming for the cameras.  All all, quirky little number that tickled just right: can't help but think that maybe missed it's mark with certain audiences. think would have been cult hit the had been shown acceptable hour.  I'll round this off with standard comment: Where the hell can get hold this watch again? Any ideas?,\n End the World uneventful movie, which odd since supposed about the total destruction the earth. The main character some kind scientist, I'm not exactly sure what kind. has two jobs government(?) facility guarded four security men. His first job monitoring transmissions and from space (although this actually seems more like hobby does when not working job #2). Job requires him put protective suit and into dark room...at least that's the best can figure. Apparently the \"plant\" not exactly top-secret, the scientist brings his wife there. She hangs out (they're their way dinner) while discovers message from space: Major Earth Disruption, repeated over and over. says something about being the first message from space he's ever been able decipher; his wife tells him they're going late for the dinner party. they leave and the party (!?!). Moments later finds out that China has suffered major earthquake. From there, the movie goes... nowhere! Yes, Christopher Lee it, but that really doesn't help much. Besides, Lee gives lackluster performance along the lines his appearance Howling II. This movie boring, but has enough stupid elements that you might want suffer through once you like Christopher Lee Z-grade sci-fi. Plus, there's lots stock footage the earth being destroyed.,\n This movie changed all for me...I heard breakdancing and hiphop, but had never seen professionally done (hey was 11-year old kid from Holland!) When saw this movie, this all changed. got actively involved the hiphop-movement our city, started breakdancing and writing lyrics.  To this day, still consider this movie personal favorite. Sure, the filming and \"cinematographic\" importance might not that significant. But who cares the wide-shot was filmed badly you could see mic hanging above somebody? It's what does you personally that counts...,\n You sit there for half hour and watch story, believing all, then watch another half hour the same story utterly unraveling... and then put back together again. Brilliant.  One the most exciting feature films the San Francisco International Film Festival documentary. don't know other than Andrew Jarecki's \"Capturing the Friedmans\" there has ever been anything like Anna Broinowski's \"Forbidden Lie$.\" features, exposes, defends, reveals, and questions everything about Norma Khouri, author \"Honor Lost,\" the acclaimed and lambasted 2001 bestseller about honor killings Jordan.  What quite incredible and what makes the film exceptional that this \"exposure\" Khouri made with Khouri's full participation.  For the initial portion the film, Khouri presents her story about the supposed honor killing friend hers Amman, the story the book. She sounds completely believable, convincing.  Then her story taken apart, exposed, eminently believable and convincing people, such women's rights activists Jordan, investigative reporters there and Australia, where Khouri lived for while.  Khouri comes back and denies the accusations, taking successful lie-detector test the process. There comes another segment devastating exposures not specified here because that would lessen the shock value... and then Khouri comes back and faces the accusations (not all, but the essential ones the matter the book).  And the Houdini act continues, with round after round this heavy-weight, seesaw prize fight, surprise after surprise and there \"happy ending\" the sense resolution. Brilliant.,\n Kazan's early film noir won Oscar. Some the reviews here into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism, and rate very highly. can almost see where they are coming from. But prefer take more toned-down approach long-forgotten film that appears have been shot practically budget and quasi-documentary fashion. Pneumonic plague loose the streets New Orleans, and military doctor (Widmark) and city detective (Douglas) apprehend the main carrier (Palance). The film moody, shot stark black and white, and makes very good use locations. Widmark wonderful usual. Forget the symbolism (crime equals disease, and disease equals crime) and just enjoy the chase. not always easy watching film like this now that are well into this new century, particular style that was very short-lived (post WWII through the early 1950s) and will unlikely interest the casual film watcher. For those who will watching this for the first time, sit tight for the big chase the end. something else, and frankly don't know how they filmed some it. can say probably took long film the finale did the first percent the movie.,\n The movie okay, has it's moments, the music scenes are the best all! The soundtrack true classic. It's perfect album, starts out with Let's Crazy(appropriate for the beginning it's great party song and very up-tempo), Take With U(a fun pop song...), The Beautiful Ones(a cheerful ballad, probably the closest thing R&B this whole album), Computer Blue(a somewhat angry anthem towards Appolonia), Darling Nikki(one the funniest songs ever, very vaguely makes fun Appolonia), When Doves Cry(the climax this masterpiece), Would Die Baby I'm Star, and, course, Purple Rain(a true classic, very appropriate ending for this classic album) The movie and the album are both very good. highly recommend them!,\n This movie surprised good way. From the box got the impression that was action thriller but was too funny thriller, even though was somewhat exciting.  There's lot nice one-liners and funny situations this movie and James Belushi was born Bill Manucci, does great job. The rest the cast ain't half-bad either and especially Timothy Dalton treat.  The story can get pretty confusing times new characters shows during the film. Things get more complicated nobody seldom tells the truth about things. you don't pay attention things might get bit messy the end but really liked it.  Louis Morneau isn't all that well known but has done perfectly job with this one and never really grew impatient while watching the movie.  Made men well worth checking out.,\n (NOTE: thought I'd the only one writing what did below, but see the others here agree. guess was pretty obvious this was overdoing the bait-the-cat bit. Anyway, here what had written:)  The owners have left vacation for two weeks trip California leaving the cat (Sylvester) all alone and locked the house. That means milk, but the cat, his relief, does find bunch canned tuna. However, his dismay, can't find the opener.  It turns out the little mouse the house has it...and baits the cat with it. This mean rodent who keeps teasing Sylvester with the opener and then yanking away the last second. Sylvester tries everything possible open the can tuna but can't it.   This frustrating story, and why they make the sadistic mouse the \"good guy\" beyond me. It's like some the Tom Jerry cartoons where poor Tom always gets the worst even though many times the little mouse starts the conflict!,\n Ernst Lubitsch's contribution the American cinema enormous. His legacy outstanding group movies that will live forever, the case with \"The Shop Around the Corner\". This film has been remade into other less distinguished movies and musical play, without the charm elegance Mr. Lubitsch's own, and definite version.  Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked several films together. Their characters this movie stand out example how movie without almost appearing acting all. Both stars are delightful the pen pals that don't know one another, but who fate had them working together the same shop Budapest.  The reason why these classic films worked well the amazing supporting casts the studios put together picture after picture. here, have the wonderful Frank Morgan, playing the owner the shop. Also, see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, doing impressive work making believe that yes, they are Budapest.  That why these films will live forever!,\n This movie awesome many levels... and none them are the level that was intended awesome on.  Just remember this: When you're watching Shaun the Dead and other recent zombie movies... they good bad... THIS the formula that they are using. THIS what makes zombie movies great.  And what makes BETTER than great the story behind the movie. simple web search will provide you with everything you need know.  All all, doesn't linger. There's never point where you think yourself \"c'mon, get with it\"... moves quick and corners nicely. This the sporty, little Italian number zombie flicks.  So awful, it's wonderful! your tongue spends ample amount time your cheek... rent it, buy it, love it.  As great trivia note: you're watching DVD, you'll notice that there sound effects during the menu screen, underneath the musical score... Well... that's because that music was lifted straight from the trailer... which probably the only working print that music that still exists which long enough loop.,\n this movie you like mindless action ,corny acting, and very small plot !The special effects are decent considering this movie from the director of\"Event Horizon\". The costumes are like something from mad max movie .None the soldiers talk ,so others tell them what do.It eventually end big shoot'em movie with explosions all the place. personally liked Russell better \"tango and cash\"\"escape from la/new york\" and \"executive decision\". must see this movie leave your mind the door for brainer action science fiction movie!!,\n documentarist, like any filmmaker, must convey compelling story. Will Pascoe fails utterly this effort, cobbling together uninspired snippets Chomsky's wisdom from visit McMaster University Hamilton. The footage shot amateurishly and video. Pascoe's only effort cohering the fragments into whole periodically throwing vague title the screen: \"9-11,\" \"Activism,\" \"Truth.\"  Lame.  Compare this with documentaries like \"The Corporation\" \"The Fog War\" which create narrative drawing material from interviews, stock footage, and filmed footage. the end each delivers poignant and insightful message deftly and intelligently.  The only saving graces the film are Chomsky's nonchalantly delivered upendings historical dogma, and the fact that the running time only minutes.  One the more interesting passages was Chomsky's recounting his experience with National Public Radio. describes the conservative media more accommodating dissenting views, while NPR's liberal dogma strait-jackets its interviewees and dramatically limits its permitted messages. Yet another media outlet skeptical of.  This documentary for Noam Chomsky completists only.,\n This isn't the best romantic comedy ever made, but certainly pretty nice and watchable. It's directed old-fashioned way and that works fine. Cybill Shepherd Corinne isn't bad her role the woman who can't get over her husband's death. She has sexy maturity. But can't say much for Ryan O'Neal Philip, because is, best, nondescript. may adequate the role, but that's not good enough.  However, get the feeling that some the characters, particularly Alex and Miranda, are not written with enough in-depth thought. don't know anything else about them because minutes after they appear the story gets thick, and the writers don't tell much beyond what happens. But that problem was salvaged because Mary Stuart Masterson has fresh-as-a-daisy sweetness brighten up, and Robert Downey Jr. charming that melts the screen. Even his smile infectious. And happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the deja and flashback scenes.  Anyway, this movie light and easy and you like them that way, why not give try. <br,\n This very well-made film, meticulously directed and with some excellent character acting that times deeply moving for example the scene with the loyal but unsophisticated sidekick cop and his wife. The plot convincingly worked out and exciting. The gangster character particularly interesting and plays almost metaphysical role the life the hero. It's made clear that the cops are just rough and ready the underworld characters.  A couple slight reservations: found the ending slightly one-sided celebrates the hero's successful integration into the structure the police and justice system, which collapses the ambiguity the police characters which has been maintained that point. Also found the lead female character somewhat weak: little more than catalyst for the salvation the hero, all she seems weep and swoon the tough guys battle out.,\n recently (May 2008) discovered that this childhood favorite was available DVD. Although I've seen great deal high quality movies since then (late 70's was 1978)), this three-episode, low budget thing still stands strong.  What's fun that now watched with year old daughter, and she experiences just the same remember from back then: The creepy music (she had hold hand, even though she's been raised with watching LotR and Resident Evil), the ever changing theories who the culprit actually is, and also complaining about the theatrical voices from era before Norway discovered the difference between stage acting and movie acting.  This the one and only good science fiction movie (or series) ever made Norway. And it's still worth watching.,\n can not believe wasted money rent this movie. thought was porn flick when started and never got any better. The acting, the music drowning out the actors. Horrible. Save your money! You have read the movie all the way through b\\c they knew the music would drowned out the speaking lines. never got the part about the slaughterhouse the need continue show cows and pigs being butchered. What did that have with the \"real\" BTK killer? understand why there were famous actors\\actresses this movie. The script would have turned away within the first page reading. You would better off watching paint dry.,\n Once upon time there was director the name James. brought wonderfully, thrilling science-fiction such Terminator and Aliens. These movies were the stuff blockbusters were made and looked have fantastic future ahead him the dawn computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry. Terminator showed gave glimpses what was possible this new era.  .......and then happened...................1997........countless awards..........obscene amounts money............outlandish barrage advertising............maximum profit margin........Titanic was here!  I have never (ever) been one jump the bandwagon and overly critical for the sake it, fact have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just get argument going. Titanic however was film only took one single positive out that Kate Winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughout!  Quickly the dialogue was like something out Beverly Hills 90210, the acting was more wooden than nephew's tree house, images meant terrify were actually comical (man falling from ship and hitting propeller), historically false (don't even get started because there's too much), had dire theme music (up there with the bodyguard for cheese) and the pointless love story was tedious, self absorbing and pathetic that disrespected the plight everyone else involved was glad when died and disappointed when she did not).  It was plainly obvious from the word that this picture was designed appeal MTV watching, bubblegum chewing, boy-with-car chasing, teenage girls (DeCaprio himself resembled something less heroic than the weedy member boy band) who would drag their sex-starved boyfriends out for three and half hour chick-flick hoping get lucky later! The worst aspect was that did not stop that point. Millions dumbed down, culture vultures went see this expensive waste celluloid because \"it cost much produce must great\" and \"Steve and Barbara said was good and they know their movies\".   The crowning glory arrived when Titanic swept the boards the Academy Awards. King James Hollywood had serious moment silence for the victims the fatal evening which his three and half hour farce was based. looked was praying for forgiveness after making fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead the death lot people.   However, people are stupid and sentimental enough buy into this kind rubbish they deserve get ripped off. Good luck Hollywood that how they want make money, I'd had those kind chances life!  It right there all time worst movies list with other silly, historically false/human interest tripe like \"The Patriot\" and \"Pearl Harbor\".,\n Definitely one favourite movies. The story good, acting great, all technicals (especially cinematography) are sharp and the script clever.  Heath Ledger terrific Edward ''Ned'' Kelly. gripping the legendary outlaw, and supported well Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All action sequences are point  The film edge-of-your seat stuff right the end. One favourite films from the late legend Heath Ledger, who has been the highlight every film has starred in. And makes mistake here.  An excellent film all round.,\n \"The Screaming Skull\" opens with warning and offer for free burial services you should die watching Now there's hook! The story itself has fairly interesting premise for horror flick: scheming husband marries wealthy woman with history mental illness, then attempts convince her that she's going insane with shrill noises, mysterious knocking and skulls that turn inopportune times. Add the formula sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory the man's first wife who was devoted to. Maybe it's just that the 1950's didn't have the technology pull off some the scare scenes needed juice this movie, the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane. But then again, when first saw \"House Haunted Hill\" nine year old, gave the heebie jeebies the same way I'm sure this film did for young viewers the same era.  Don't get wrong, the film not terrible, just seems get tedious times. But there's some great atmospheric tension the generally huge but unfurnished Whitlock home, and the gardens and pool are nice touch. For the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) going maniacal the pond attempting retrieve the hidden skull, just wades right clothes and all, neat contrast the mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol dual role). makes you wonder who the real dimwit was.  In it's own good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the film: how about that neat roadster the Whitlock's make their first appearance gull wing doors 1958! That least made jump out seat!,\n God Bless 80's slasher films. This fun, fun movie. This what slasher films are all about. Now I'm not saying horror movies, just slasher films. goes like this: high school nerd picked all these stupid jocks and cheerleaders, and then one their pranks goes horribly wrong. Disfigured and back for revenge, sporting Joker/Jester mask (pretty creepy looking, might add), Marty begins kill off those teens one one many years later, after manages make them believe that their old abandoned high school having reunion. That basically the plot? What's wrong with that? That's the beauty 80's slasher films, most them would say. lot things could ridiculous, but they keep drawing you more an' they by. Especially this film.  It features some outrageous killings, and some are quite creative well. (poisoning beer can, acid bath, can't remember javelin ever being used before any other slasher film either)It really fun, fun movie. That's all is. Nevermind the fact that the characters are complete idiots, never mind their stupidity, and never mind the outrageous, random things that occur this film. Such lights being able controlled the killer (when he's not even switching any buttons, you'll see) and toilets being able cough blood, baths being able have acid come out them, just use that part your entertainment! Because thats what really makes entertaining.  Movies like this represent 80's slashers. Never again could movies like this get made, know why? isn't the 80's anymore. That why you should just cherish them for what they are, good fun! highly recommend this film you're hardcore fan Slahsers such Friday the 13th.  One last note this movie also had kick ass villain well, Marty Rantzen. disfigured, nerd, who kills all his old foes creepy Jester mask. good villain makes good slasher. Simon Scuddamore, who played Marty apparently committed suicide shortly after Slaughter High was released. That alone adds something creepy the film, and sticks with and even makes you feel more sorry for the Marty character, guess. All all, great 80's slashers fun! It's shame will never the same again...,\n Director Douglas Sirk scores again with this, the grandaddy all dysfunctional family films. This lush, trashy saga masterpiece, beautifully combining all the elements Sirk's soapers and strategically placing them all into one movie. \"Written the Wind\" very obviously influenced the 1980s series \"Dallas\" and \"Dynasty\", this basically feature-length version those later nighttime soaps.  Lauren Bacall, wonderfully and subtly, plays Lucy Moore, New York City secretary who marries oil baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unbeknownst both them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) also love with the quiet, but sexy secretary. They all back Kyle's family's mansion Texas where meet his white trash slut-of-a-sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone Oscar-winning turn). Yipee! The sparks begin fly from the romances the catfights, this campy trip. Not only does Mitch have fight the feelings has for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries sleep with everybody since she can't have her one true love who Mitch. Topping all off, Kyle learns he's impotent, but somehow Lucy ends pregnant.  This pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love it? This film signals one Universal's most popular films and one director Sirk's best works. Some the dialogue absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown every which way the theme wind throughout great. The cast great, although Bacall completely underused despite receiving top-billing behind Hudson. Stack's Oscar loss reportedly devastated him. considered this his finest performance and apparently was none too pleased lose out. And did turn out fabulous performance the whimpering alcoholic. What stunning movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for ages Sirk the master classic melodrama. Where's his Oscar? <br,\n The interesting aspect \"The Apprentice\" demonstrates that the traditional job interview and resume not necessarily predict teamwork skills, task dedication, and job performance. And they certainly don't reveal any hidden agendas. other words, good indicator potential may see job applicant action which the point \"The Apprentice\". People vying for corporate position may hand over sugar-coated resume and put their best personality attire for the interview, but these are not necessarily the best indicator strengths, weaknesses, and performance.  Briefly, \"The Apprentice\" involves job candidates competing for the ultimate career opportunity: position real estate magnate Donald Trump's investment company. \"The Apprentice\" refers the winner who will win salaried position, learn the art high stakes deal-making from the master himself, and, presumably, gain prime corporate connections. The position dream-come-true for those wanting make more money than the GNP some foreign countries. entice the candidates, Trump shows off his private jet, his private luxury apartments replete with statues and artwork, his limos, his connections celebrities, and other aspects the life billionaire magnate.  The road success not easy. The group divided into two teams that compete against each other. Each has corporate-sounding name, such Versacorps and Protégé Corporation. The teams are assigned tasks that entail entrepreneurial venture such creating advertising, selling merchandise, negotiating. Teams select project manager who provides the leadership and organizational skills complete the task. they win, the manager receives lot credit, particularly the eyes the final arbiter. they lose, the manager may also become the scape-goat. Some the tasks are monumentally difficult with only day two complete. Tasks may involve creating commercial, print ad. Others may involve selling retail outlet the street.  The tasks bring out the best and worst the participants. They often show immediately who the most reliable, who the most trustworthy, and who hard working. And the tasks also expose who not good team player, who inefficient, and who seems only out for themselves. The tasks invariably reveal unexpected ways the strengths and weaknesses the participants and particular the project manager. How well the manager communicates with the team, delegates work, organizes time, and sets specific goals will largely determine the outcome, but does not necessarily predict the winner.  The single-most telling aspect someone's potential when she assigned project manager. Their real abilities opposed their self-propagated abilities immediately show through the veneer that cannot hidden $100 silk tie beautiful makeover. Leadership qualities and/or weaknesses often become agonizingly obvious after only few minutes. Those promoting themselves top-notch leaders are not always strong when put into real-life leadership situation. always easier \"toot your own horn\" than actually engage leadership. Project managers, even those the winning teams, often not formulate cohesive strategy. They often believe that diving off the deep end complete the task the first minute rather than taking little time organize and discuss how the task will completed more efficient. More often than not, members ill-strategized team are running around like headless chickens figuring out they along, and the long run they end wasting far more time.  The winning team gets taste the high life, such eating dinner exclusive restaurant, flying private jet, and/or meeting celebrity. The losing team comes the dreaded board room where Trump hears the lame excuses the members and knocks off one more the contestants like pieces off chess board with the now infamous \"You're fired\". Often, the project manager held partially responsible for the team's loss, and may the target Trump's accusatory rhetoric. Every week, least one person becomes casualty from the losing team.   My least-favorite aspect \"The Apprentice\" the board room. While the tasks themselves bring out the strengths and weaknesses the candidates, the board room often brings out the worst. Unfortunately, the rules the game insist there one winning team and one losing team, even the competition was close. Members the losing team start accusing each other, often ruthlessly, about who was fault. And sometimes more than one person gets fired. seldom see under-performing candidate take responsibility for their actions the board room. Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson were possibly the only candidates who took full responsibility for her team's losses and received recognition for this selfless act. For me, Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson had the most integrity all the candidates. However, Trump saw Kristi weak and fired her, claiming she wasn't standing for herself, which may mean values ego more than integrity. one should sacrifice their integrity for this. Kristi Frank may not have become the apprentice but she can live with herself knowing she did not blame others unjustly. Isn't that worth much \"winning\"?  The strength \"The Apprentice\" also its weakness. Because team performance evaluated strictly winners and losers, other evaluation opportunities are overlooked. Barring huge gaps between the winning and losing teams, sometimes losing team exemplifies high standard teamwork and efficiency. have seen losing teams sometimes appearing better organized than the winning team. Americans are often obsessed with winning and losing that often overlook excellence.,\n was greatly moved when watched the movie.how jonny could keep such hope and faith was amazing. many people only care about what they want and fuss about all the things they don't have and they are such small things ,like chothes,money new car i've seen people tears because blemish. this movie brings everything back the basics love,hope the beauty the simple but important things life.it makes our everyday problems seen for what they are Small and really unimportant. you watch this boy and you realize long you have been blessed with food roof over your head and your loved ones around you .you are truly blessed.and the saying stop and smell the roses truly has new meaning.and know jonny will see this and want thank him much for sharing such faith,strenght,and humor with .thank you jonny know you soar the heavens and bring much love and laughter the heavens above.,\n This movie very realistic view police squad small german town seen through the eyes woman recruit. She brings her way dealing with the law, which means more than simple convictions. The strong performance the main character, supported good dialogues makes this flick very enjoyable.,\n What happens when you give free man just enough money trap him into the rat race and watch him squirm? Homeless people answer one. They have mortgages, rent payments idiot bosses. Homeless people don't have worry about the IRS performance reviews credit card payments. But, give them just enough money rent apartment and buy car and, suddenly, they have worry about entering the rat race, buying gas for transportation, paying insurance their car, and working for someone else. They get chance \"productive citizens.\" This film was about exploitive film can be. It's way for the rich and middle-class sheeple say \"see what happens when you try help the poor?\" and vindicates capitalistic arrogance.  Why not film that asks, \"What happens when you take away everything rich man has?\",\n Rob Roy and underrated epic passion and action!SOME MILD SPOILERS WITHIN. Liam Neeson gives towering performance Rob Roy MacGregor,one the best his career.Jessica Lange letter-perfect his wife Mary.They have the most passion and chemistry I've seen screen couple.John Hurt gives his best snotty aristocrat performance.Tim Roth portrays one the great screen villains.His rape Mary repugnant and harrowing.He really magnificent bastard this movie.The final duel between Rob and Cunningham one the best swordfights ever.Well scripted ans scored,and Michael Caton-Jones direction flawless. out 10.,\n `Mad Dog' Earle back, along with his sad-sack moll Marie, and that fickle clubfoot Velma. are Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac, and even the scenery-chewing mutt Pard. The only thing missing good reason for remaking Raoul Walsh's High Sierra years later without rethinking line frame, and doing with talent noticeably rung two down the ladder from that the original. (Instead Walsh get Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart get Jack Palance, for Ida Lupino Shelley Winters, and down through the credits.) The only change that, this time, instead black-and-white, it's Warnercolor; sadly, there are those who would count this improvement.  I Died Thousand Times may unnecessary and inferior but least it's not travesty; the story still works its own stagy terms. Earle (Palance), fresh out the pen near Chicago, drives west spearhead big job masterminded ailing kingpin Lon Chaney, Jr. knocking over post mountain resort. route, almost collides with family Oakies, when he's smitten with their granddaughter; the smiting holds even when discovers she's lame. Arriving the cabins where the rest gang holes up, finds amateurish hotheads one another's throats well Winters, who throws herself him (as does the pooch). Biding time until they get call from their inside man the hotel, Palance (to Winter's chagrin) offers pay for operation cure the girl's deformity, gesture that backfires. Then, the surgical strike against the resort turns into bloodbath. the lam, Palance moves higher into the cold Sierras....  It's absorbing enough story, competently executed, that lacks the distinctiveness Walsh and his cast brought 1941, the year Bogie, with this role and that Sam Spade the Maltese Falcon, became star. And one last, heretical note: Those mountains look gorgeous color. <br,\n saw Crispin Glover's \"What It?\" the Ann Arbor film festival. Admittedly, the film was least aptly named, because got the distinct sense that even the writer/director could provide answer. the question and answer session after the screening, Mr. Glover said that the film was originally meant short film show the virtue using actors with down-syndrome. However, this itself not enough reason create film. Actors are, opinion, building blocks for larger vision larger vision that seemed muddled best and absent worst.  Crispin Glover also said that wanted address taboo subjects. Well, does that. But why? The film seems have stance, reason for addressing anything. Does feel these things shouldn't taboo? The film doesn't even give indicator that. Taboo for the sake taboo not interesting. can't even afford make the taboo disturbing inciting any level because hasn't made the audience care any way.   Ignoring problems with the concept for moment, the thing that actually shocked most was how poorly the film was put together. The editing, cinematography, and other technical aspects seemed frequently extremely amateur. Glover said 125-150 thousand dollars went into the movie, and feel that the money should have been spent different designers (Glover actually did some design himself know saw least sound design the credits). The painted sets are okay (not great), but used poorly. Parts feel like photographed stage play which would fine that went any sort purpose, but Glover's hands just feels sloppy. Other parts are filmed like sort Home Movie, inferior quality lot the stuff see first-time filmmakers iMovie.  Perhaps the biggest problem with \"What It?\" can't even understand how seriously the film taken. There are some parts that feel like Glover screaming you think seriously. other points, seems off his own little joke. Perhaps meant for this ironic, meaningful some way, but just felt that Glover couldn't even get himself give his film any sort serious attention.  Glover said originally wanted short film. only had been. seventy-two minutes, the film runs out imagery and ideas the first twenty, and arguable the ideas were formulated enough claim that they were even there for that period time.,\n Full House great family show. However, after watching some episodes over and over again I've realized that they're incredibly boring and they seem shelter themselves from the outside world lot. Yes, there lot comedy, but there are times when it's incredibly cheesy. It's not like hate it, but just don't watch them over and over again because they get old quick. Probably the best season the first.  Full House about widower Danny Tanner(Bob Saget)and his three daughters D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). When Danny's wife dies the need some help. So, his best friend Joey (Dave Coulier) and the girls' Uncle Jesse (John Stamos) moves with them. Once they live there together they find they can't live without each other.   Full House reminds you just how important family and that you can always home again.,\n This movie very great! The acting fine, with excellent casting Corbin Bernsen the perfectionistic dentist who freaks out and tortures his patients. the beginning sees his wife with the poolman, and then goes crazy. also takes revenge his wife and the poolman, beside the patients tortures. The most special effects are also beautiful, although some are really fake (like drilled-out tongue, that has laid for night outside, and still red the morning). But the torture scenes are absolutely well-done. Though this movie has the weak point that very slow; between the heavy parts are sometimes just extremiously boring parts. But for the real horror/thriller-fan this must-watch!,\n This 1986 Italian-French remake the 1946 film the same name turns the heat early, and doesn't let come for air. The story about high-school student (Federico Pitzalis) who can't keep his eyes off the mysteriously beautiful young woman (played Dutch phenom Maruschka Detmers) who lives next door the school. One day, follows her, and his persistence pays off. There's only one problem: She's engaged sketchy character (Riccardo Torrebruna) who may may not have committed heinous crime, and repents, will probably let off with slap the wrist. Also, the young woman little \"funny the head\", and this corroborated when discover she has been seeing the boy's father, who psychiatrist. Giulia's emotional instability only equalled her prodigious sexual desires. Hot, hot, hot, from the word go, with handsome leads and bombshell performance from Detmers, who plays like yo-yo (as she does the boy) from scene scene, with enough suspense keep guessing right until--and even after--the end. Available and (!) rated versions.,\n didn't give this movie perfect score order honest comparing great classics like \"Citizen Kane\" and \"Seven Samaurai.\" However, this movie all-around wonderful, it's real shame scores poorly for the general IMDb voter. However, the IMDb voter leans the geeky, and \"Paulie\" doesn't qualify for that.  The only acting criticism might suggest that Hallie Kate Eisenberg didn't portray the perfect stuttering child. I'm sorry, but asking year-old child out-do Dustin Hoffman the Rainman asking for the impossible film-making.  Moving past that minor complaint, the movie has the best many films: buddy road-trip, con-games, hero friendly party-animal (party-bird?), Disney-like humor for young and old, etc. What's not like? Tony Shaloub wears his role like pair comfortable jeans. That's normal for him, seems. (\"I'm Russian... LIKE long stories.) don't like mangoes, but almost makes want out and buy one. Watch the movie and that will make sense.  Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin make very appropriate appearances the film. Roles that are quite fitting what all know about them. have always found Jay Mohr bit slimy, and his on-screen role fits that well. The only surprise was finding that Jay was also Paulie's voice. the end, even that works well; put Parrot and anti-Parrot together team and creates magic its own.  If you are trying find film for you and the kids that neither insulting nor boring for either, \"Paulie\" perfect candidate. will, however, admit that happy moment colors review \"Paulie.\" was road-trip during major heat-wave. The car's air-conditioning died, half the restaurants had dead cooling (as did our hotel) and said, \"let's watch movie where there working air-conditioning.\" did. for 100 minutes were cooled, amused, and given heart-warming experience. When saw recently VCR under less emotional circumstances, realized just how well this movie was made.  It's sleeper film you won't regret watching.,\n I'm not fan the Left Behind book series the books are written 6th-grade reading level with lack research and understanding science, technology, and politics. While the books manage remain faithful scripture, their methods fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous (an example their explanation for the Russian/Arab invasion Israel). Also, the books have unmistakable preachy tone that will turn off unbelievers rather than bring them the gospel. Still, found myself reading these books because interest the events Revelation. For similar reason, watched this film adaptation. sad say that rather mediocre film bordering poor. The acting actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits poor acting and over-acting. The script rather bad, though hardly unexpected when starting with the novel basis. The characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped. Events feel scattered and disconnected. The dialogue sometimes sounds rushed. least the book managed flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory. Here, the viewer left with incoherent mess that only makes much sense one has read the book. The pacing the film also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed, and the middle dragging excruciatingly slow trudge that makes feel padded. The music schizophrenic. times, successfully underscores the mood and sounds fitting for motion picture. other moments, reminds sitcom and mini-series music. And still other bits remind poppy MTV soundtrack that just doesn't belong the film. can give the film points for the scene panic board the plane, but that's it. The other scenes involving the disasters after the Rapture are far from compelling. The film also suffers from the book's preachiness although its message isn't quite your face. all, found the movie just disappointing the series. This not the film rally Christians around it. hope that this film does NOT get any attention the theaters next year. would more unnecessary bad publicity for Christianity. For example compelling, intelligent, well-researched series based Revelation that presents realistic and Christian world view without offending the secular reader (who after all should whom Christian trying reach) read the Christ Clone trilogy James BeauSeigneur. It's great read and much better choice for unbelievers believers who appreciate quality.,\n I'm fan both actors/singers especially Gackt and when first discover this movie and watch the trailer,I just think this silly one.After long waiting time,I watched last and here's comment...  I consider everyone knows the storyline and not going mention about it,instead first applause goes acting,generally that Japanese movies hasn't got brilliant and acting.Yet MoonChild's all cast simply wonderful and got into it,especially Gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes pretty well,I like many his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones,as for HYDE part,his acting good but deliberately staying background actor,respectively his character do,throughout the movie.I didn't like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due small budget,it still has brilliant moments,but the real jewel the film story.It has some cheesy moments but it's for me,and the friendship theme the movie really well developed and touching sometimes,on the other hand story points out cruel world which ones life guaranteed and with some memorable death scenes reflects this theme the visuals.An interesting note aside,this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie Interwiew with the Vampire which also played the most beautiful(not handsome,beautiful)actors American cinema,actually Moon Child somehow can seen brother with Interwiew,yet original it's own.Only problem that MoonChild it's bit slow sometimes,I'm Japanese movie fan and used that but it's not change MoonChild has some useless scenes characters.But all all;this movie really good and very emotional sometimes,as for actors/singers duo hope see their other movies future,and recommend this everyone who likes vampire-action-sci-fiction and romance films 8/10,\n When heard that Adrian Pasdar was drag this movie, expectations that would watch the entire movie were low. The only reasons gave chance were the magnificent Julie Walters and the recommendation friend.  What thought would broad \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" type farce turned out gentle and insightful comedy. Pasdar entirely credible and empathetic the ambitious business man who needs release the female part his being cross-dressing occasions. transmits these needs the audience thoroughly believable fashion. Julie Walters magnificent, her habit, the landlady who teaches him unconditional love.,\n Now recently had the viewing pleasure watch the hilarious comedy Bachelor Party, one new favorite comedies, laughed until just hurt type movies. naturally wanted see the sequel, hoping would have the same laughs, but instead Bachelor Party The Last Temptation made the American Pie generation where it's tasteless and defeats the hole purpose the first film. Yeah, the first film has nudity, but doesn't show every single scene. Also the plot exactly the same from the first, it's not always complaint with me, but this could have been little more original. The only thing that I'm glad that least old actors from the original appear this movie, because would have been cheesy really silly looking.  Ron and Melinda are engaged, after only months dating, everyone against it. Melinda has rich family, but they're pretty happy with Ron, and Melinda's brother, Todd scared that Ron will take his job. they out weekend Miami for bachelor party and Todd going make sure that he'll trap Ron into picture that will make Melinda change her mind about the marriage.  Bachelor Party The Last Temptation has couple laughs here and there, but over all fails deliver what the first film accomplished. These guys, Ron's friends, were more obnoxious than likable, except for Seth, was kinda funny. The only likable characters other than Seth Ron and Melinda, everyone else just more less gets your nerves. You wanna watch this film? Just watch Girls Gone Wild, it's the same thing only doesn't try pretend that it's film. Stick the original Bachelor Party, that's the movie that's going get you tears laughter.  3/10,\n Mat Spirogolou's (Toby Malone) family know talented footballer, and are pleased when secures audition join big club. They hope that when arrives the city his cousin will look after him.  But the cousins are like chalk and cheese: one naive farm boy, the other streetwise spendthrift who has managed get mixed with drug dealers and gangsters. Mat unlikely have quiet evening before his big day.  Having missed his cousin George (Damien Robertson) arrival the city, Mat encounters further trouble when young biker takes him for ride more ways than one.  Toby Malone, probably better known for his work theatre, puts commendable performance the bucolic teenager. There are telltale signs low budget, but with many other low-budget movies there's more fun, seemingly more spontaneity, and more charm, than there seen the average Hollywood blockbuster.,\n Flame in, flame out. That seems Gammera nutshell, prehistoric creature who can take and dish out with equal abandon. I'm not fan Japanese monster films, but wound committed viewing all the flicks the fifty film DVD sci-fi collection put out Mill Creek/Treeline Films. It's great value about twenty five bucks, fifty cents per movie, really boils down investment time watch some the goofy offerings.  Gammera riled from centuries long slumber nuclear blast, and he's not happy. Like Godzilla, takes out Tokyo, setting the United Nations into motion try and come with plan save the planet. They arrive 'Plan Z', the hope the world, and wouldn't you know it, there's scene where huge shed shown that's called the Plan' building; that was nice touch.  By the mid 1960's, this country still wasn't quite politically correct. One the American military scenes the Alaskan Air Defense Sector has General Arnold asking female sergeant make coffee. guess there weren't any privates around.  Good old Gammera was quite the sight though, walking around two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged. That's why surprised how Plan managed capture turtle man the nose cone hidden space ship, whisking him off Mars save the world. High fives all around for the American and Russian team that made the save, now let's get back the Cold War.  Like Godzilla, Gammera spawned least good dozen films, but having seen this one pretty much satisfies interest flying, flaming turtles. Especially since that DVD pack mentioned earlier has \"Attack the Monsters\" with featured guest appearance the Big took all had make through the end both films; was such relief get the final frame this one that said 'Gammera, Sayonara!\",\n Judging from this film and THE STRONG MAN, made the same year, would not place Harry Langdon the top the list great silent screen comedians. There simply not enough there. Perhaps was his way developing his style but sabotaged himself taking his first big successes too seriously. any event, all his tricks are reminiscent the greater funny men, but lacks the acrobatic skills Keaton and the prodigious ingenuity Lloyd. also undermines his own persona dressing and walking like Chaplin's tramp character. His trademarks are childlike innocence, timidity approach and tendency under-react calamity looking perplexed, batting his eyes touching his pursed lips with the tip his forefinger. The comedy Langdon's films results from fate throwing various obstacles his path which tries overcome wimpy naïve ways with minimum physicality, such throwing rocks approaching tornado drive away, propping collapsing building with two-by-four dodging boulders lifting leg that they roll under him. this story, about the son shoemaker who joins cross-country walking race publicize rival company's footwear, manages win sheer luck. There nothing here that hasn't been done far better the Big Three.,\n happened see this movie twice more and found well made! WWII had freshly ended and the so-called \"Cold War\" was about begin. This movie could, therefore, defined one the best \"propaganda\", patriotic movies preparing Americans and, secondly, people from the still formed \"Western NATO block\" countries face the next coming menace. The movie celebrates the might the US, through the centuries, while projecting itself onwards the then present war, which had just ended. Nice and funny the way describing the discovering the American Continent Columbus and pretty the \"espisode\" New Amsterdam and the purchasing Manhattan from drunk local Indian Must see (at least once, for curiosity fashion propaganda through time)!,\n This wasn't funny 1972. It's not funny now.  Unlike lot other people, I'm not bashing the film because incredibly sexist quote enjoyed that bit, rather enjoyed the reaction generates annoying people I'm bashing because poorly written and acted.  The only really memorable character Blakey, which British people years old will recognise immediately since was favourite with impressionists for long time.  Avoid. <br,\n *** REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS *** I'll make this review short and sweet. bought this movie from Best Buy because sounded interested and had some top actors like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad could be, right? Well, it's pretty bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, wannabe journalist who stumbles across case that may lead corrupt cops Edison's Police Force. Cool Deed, cop within the force special force team called F.R.A.T. (First Response Assault Tactics). He's teamed with \"on-the-edge\" bad cop named Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). the opening scene see Lazerov Deed taking some bank robbers, but night they are busting couple guys doing drugs. don't want give much away, but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman) goes trial involving Deeds Lazerov. suspect foul play and with the help Ashford, does some investigate that turns ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey) who all within the F.R.A.T. team joins with Ashford try bring the corrupt cops justice.  You can tell from the beginning that Freeman and Spacey's performance are pretty lackluster. The only person that give all out performance Dylan McDermott. complete nut case this movie and made believer out me. Cool terrible this film. says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion. was much better movies like Deep Blue Sea Any Given Sunday. The film starts off with some nice action but then drags feet through the rest the film. The ending far from satisfying.  Don't waste your time with this film. I'm putting Ebay this weekend.,\n I'm both amused and disgusted the people who claim that this movie accurate about Vietnam, and WERE NEVER THERE. This movie about true about the whole Vietnam war the Rodney King beating true about ALL police officers. Yes, bad things (and did) happen, but general the people there are just like you and me. They have morals, they are not killing machines, they not all drugs. Atrocities were the exception Vietnam, not the rule. They happened far more infrequently than the \"hype\" would lead you believe. Oliver Stone has knack for making movies that show the Vietnam war this brutal bloodbath, but are based much reality Star Wars. you honestly believe the stereotypes Vietnam, yourself favour and learn the truth. Fact: the Viet Cong and NVA did far worse things the South Vietnamese than ANY soldier the Armed Forces ever did. Fact: the soldiers World War treated the enemy far worse general than the soldiers Vietnam did, and they were WELCOMED when they came home. The fine Americans who served this country Vietnam deserve our respect; though the war was badly fought from political standpoint, one could have asked for more from our soldiers, and great disservice assert that this kind \"mostly true\" fiction the way things really were there.,\n fact, these young people were distasteful that couldn't wait for all 'em get slaughtered, and that includes Clarissa (Joanna Canton) since considered her the most annoying the bunch.  But knew was gonna mess from the opening minutes when teen Christine opened fired the priest and the nuns with the Leslie Gore music playing the background. had nowhere but down.  Even the prosthetics looked fake and the \"blood\" looked suspiciously like Hawaiian Punch, although later took red day-glo look match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing. I'm sure all the GOTH morons out there will appreciate this bullsh-t since it'll appeal that bunch. sure didn't appeal me. Blah...  And not even favorite horror babe Adrienne Barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself. She still looks hot, though. I'm glad she takes care herself since don't get see too much her nowadays.  However, step from Dante Tomaselli's meandering HORROR (2002) that has somewhat coherent plot, I'll give that much. That and the little Boston terrier named Boozer also brings notch. like what Boozer does Clarissa the end. was the only good scene otherwise silly film.  Lion's Gate Films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up.  2 out,\n This very good movie. you want know the real reasons why many here are knocking this movie? will tell you. this movie, you have black criminal who outwits white professor. black cop who tells the white professor wrong for defending the black criminal and the black cop turns out right, thus. making the white professor look stupid. always comes down race. This excellent movie. Pay attention the racist. you can get over that there are characters who are played blacks this movie who outsmart the white characters, then you shouldn't have any problems enjoying this movie. recommended everyone see this movie.,\n liked it! The plot was weird, Drew Barrymore and making out was awkward for both them. Drews acting was dodgy places but this could down her life the time. Dennis Christopher the shrink was pretty cool, and always does his best i'm major Dennis fan anyway, that's why bought the DVD.  I didn't get the ending! that weird animatronic red skeleton thing looked just like was out filmschool, which guess but could have been more.   ....and the whole thing with the knife- was that uncomfortable why didn't they just get rid it?   It was very confusing when was the Doppelganger weird thing when was DC-or was Dennis all the time? Because the Doppelganger made out with Dennis and Patrick. the scenes with Patrick was Dennis the Doppelganger then think Patrick would notice.  The music was but obtrusive places, the whole orchestral score seemed revolving around theme but this theme was overdone.  A big mix lots blood and gratuitus shots Drew nude.   All all bit GPM-Guilty Pleasure Movie. Don't read too much into it, don't look for secret messages and fantastic script because you wont find it. There are some diamond moments and goofs galore- WATCH AND JUST HAVE BIT FUN WITH IT!,\n the quintessential narcissist and manipulator; this case, portraying attorney (and murderer) Tom Capano.  Kathryn Morris sympathetic victim, Anne Marie Fahey, but the beginning bit too much the victim. are sorry for the situation, but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization several other women (including Rachel Ward) well.  The sad part where she actually getting help with her self-esteem issues, and Capano actually had her psychologist killed. Pretty hard believe, but this was based true story.  There cameo with Olympia Dukakis (excellent) Capano's mother. All all, interesting story because based true murder, and you will want read Ann Rule's book get the accurate details. 8/10.,\n Being fan Billy Bob Thornton, and the diversity his skills, noticed this movie listed, and was surprised hadn't heard it.  I'd traveled more than usual during both the period was being filmed 2000, and when hit theaters more than 2-1/2 years later (that passage time the first clue all was not well with the production).  Now Patrick Swayze can't act for sour apples, but Thornton has more than enough ability make-up for the difference between them. And Charlize Theron someone whom would pleasure see, even showed her watching paint dry.  Being curious, checked this site's production info. made whopping $600 per screen its opening weekend, and just over $400 each, after its month's theater run latter 2002. Overall gross was $261K, which I'd doubt could cover cast and crew's hotel and food for week location.  The story pretty benign, and even the use the usually interesting locale Reno dull the rest the goings-on.  It's something like several SNL bits all pieced together, none individually too great all, and the overall presentation even worse.  Whatever, the expenses for this production had considerable even all worked for less than their usual fees the one thing which made barely tolerable opus was the quality the filming and Billy Bob's present (albeit understandably somewhat laconic here compared with his usual work.  Think the three superb, totally diverse characters portrayed \"Sling Blade,\" \"Bandits\" and \"Bad Santa,\" and you know realized this work was below standard, long before the viewers had the opportunity confirm this. One star for him, even here, and one because production was better than, say, the typical \"Lifetime\" flick.,\n ******* SPOILER! ********  i saw this gr8 film few years back, its lovely story about young fella who wants drink his mothers milk the breast but she thinks old for it. ends lusting after another ladies breasts and ends competition with his brother who fancies her. throw jealous husband this woman who cannot get \"aroused\" and you have cheeky yet warm story about love, friendship and lovely pairs jugs hehe  its brilliant  dont put off sub-tit-les hehe!,\n The exclamation point the title appropriate, albeit understatement. This movie doesn't just cry shrieks loud enough shatter glass.  Filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone made shrill, humorless suspense thrillers that strove for semi-documentary feel. Here, they shot actual New York locations with tinny \"real-life\" acoustics jack the verisimilitude. But the naturalism the sound recording only serves amplify the Stones' maladroit dialog and the mouth-frothing histrionics tortured butterfly Inger Stevens.  In performance completely devoid modulation, Stevens plays the wife electronics whiz James Mason (looking haggard and bored); both are held captive extortionist Rod Steiger (looking bloated and bored) and his slimy cohorts scheme blackmail airline with deadly bomb that Mason has unwittingly helped construct.  Here another credibility-straining instance criminal mastermind brilliantly attentive every detail, yet knuckleheaded enough hire drug-addicted degenerate underling. The Stones' idea nail-biting tension trap the hysterical Stevens alone with Benzedrine-popping rapist Neville Brand, filling the frame with his sweaty, drooling kisser. But the camera work leaden and Brand (uncharacteristically) demure that the effect hardly lurid, much less suspenseful. The Stones, square pair heart, don't even have the courage their own lack convictions.  The film, which ends with the portly Steiger chasing the fleet-footed Stevens subway train track, clumsy its ungainly heavy. With Angie Dickinson Steiger's amoral girlfriend, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey, and Barney Philips.,\n This movie was billed comedy and mystery. fails badly both. The only mystery here why would anybody make such poorly constructed movie. The only comedy the laugh got when saw how high the readers here ranked it. Could there two movies with the same name? The movie saw starred girl with pretty blue eyes and plot that wasn't there. <br,\n Classic, highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth horror icon and launched the careers both director Carpenter and star Curtis.  Seemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns his hometown where begins stalk local babysitter Halloween.  Halloween film that never fails live its reputation horror masterpiece! Carpenter's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that must seen really felt! The direction often consists such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaking doors, that makes even the everyday setting small town neighborhood truly creepy. Carpenter well-times his suspense and his jolting shocks make them the most effectively startling, that itself feat few horror filmmakers ever manage! Plus, wise enough give some truly likable young characters and very scary villain keep the tension all the more strong. Highest kudos also Carpenter's simple, yet frighteningly unnerving music score. sense, Halloween fine example perfect horror film!  The cast excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis does very nice turn lovable babysitter Laurie Strode, she's good that she would number other horror films before breaking into bigger films. The great Donald Pleasants does perfect performance Myer's doctor, who's desperate capture him again. Supporting cast Loomis, Soles, Castle, and others are good too.  So like its own villain, Halloween unstoppable force that never fails thrill and chill. MUST for all genre fans!  **** out ****,\n the front cover says \"The hamlet our time, for our time\".  I had study this filmed version Hamlet directly after watching Keneth Branagh's version and was truly disappointing experience.  This version takes different approach several aspects the play including sexuality; one very VERY homosexual Osric and interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. think for the time (60's) this was very well done version Hamlet but cannot compare Branagh's complete version.  just note... found the video local video store (in Australia) and I'm actually looking for Keneth Branagh DVD buy such thing even exists. anyone knows one please tell me.,\n went not knowing anything about this movie and walked out half hour knowing everything about it. was one worst movies I've ever seen. I'm generally nice person but somebody told they liked this movie, would probably never talk them again. Anybody who likes throughly most likely have extremely dry, hermit type personality. I'm gonna also include that they think they are pretty intelligent too, just like the self-centered fart bags who the voices for the movie. know everyone has different types humor, some people may not even like mine, but that's okay; don't think this covers any range humor though. This movie flat and dull Wes Anderson's mind. and get ready walk out; it's best get your money back too.,\n has been said that Deanna Durbin invented teenagery. This first film was one the best. The humorous story presented delightful year old Deanna, little beauty with gorgeous voice, the \"Miss Fixit\" family split divorce. For plot summary, see other IMDb entries, but quickly Deanna and her two older sisters plan America from Switzerland prevent their father from remarrying. With excellent supporting cast especially Barbara Read and Nan Grey the sisters, good direction and editing, the film succeeds captivating one even subsequent viewings. Deanna's three songs, only \"Il Bacio\" from the classical repertoire, but when she sings that police station scene, the film's place history assured. least was for this viewer who the age was smitten for life with both Deanna and classical music. One the many nice touches that occur throughout THREE SMART GIRLS the brief glimpse the drunk stretching his neck for final glimpse Deanna the cops hustle him by! One unfortunate result the success this film was that subsequent writers for Durbin vehicles became locked into the \"Miss Fixit\" theme, which quickly became stale. Deanna herself never did. Her stature actress more questionable than her charisma, which she certainly had. seems that, like many another film personality, she substituted \"naturalness\" for the histrionic ability that she lacked. The ploy worked well for feature films.,\n I'm fond this film and vexes that many \"reviewers\" rank below the Peter Jackson trilogy. filmed novel always interpretive; particular animated film relies the artist's vision and should judged its own terms. Speaking purist, this finer homage Tolkien than the updated version. While this film has its flaws stays truer the source, especially far the characters are concerned.  In the Jackson version Tolkien's Frodo barely recognizable: from the first scenes portrayed weakling, constantly wavering, manipulated forces around him and never standing his own two feet (this physically and metaphorically true.) You wonder why fate chose this limp biscuit carry the one ring the Cracks Doom. Jackson unforgivably rewrites Tolkien and robs Frodo his finest moment when allows Arwen rescue him from the Ringwraiths...Bakshi's version respects the original, presenting Frodo who demands the wraiths \"Go back and trouble more!\" Bakshi sustains Frodo's character Tolkien conceived it. see his decline the weight his burden increases. Frodo pivotal Lord the Rings you wonder why Jackson took such liberties (he does with numerous characters)since character development propels the plot its inevitable conclusion. Bakshi's film better explores the companionship between Legolas and Gimli few judicious scenes that are completely lacking Jackson's version. Similarly see Boromir horsing with Pippin and Merry, furthering the idea fellowship. For liking the camaraderie more developed the animated version than the live action.  Tolkien's poetry important ingredient the novels and Bakshi makes tribute this one favorite scenes: when Frodo sings the \"Merry Old Inn\" song, minutes before stumbling into Strider. The cheery tune chillingly juxtaposed with the darker theme music when seconds later, invisible his friends but visible the wraiths, Frodo dangerously exposed. This one the most atmospheric portions the film and chills whenever see it.  The well documented budget/time restrictions limit this film's final impact but had been completed may have resonated with more viewers. is, it's worth look. Even its detractors admit that Peter Jackson derived much his inspiration from this prototype.,\n There word for this sort film, and that word \"drivel.\" was drivel when was VHS rental, and it's drivel satellite re-runs now.  It might fool you, because has moderately well-known names Kistofferson and Henriksen, reasonable soundtrack music, and nice Monument Valley scenery.  It also has some curly haired woman who fights lot.  If that's all you want from movie, then maybe this will keep you happy.  It's still drivel, though.,\n fail see the appeal this series (which supposed sci-fi). It's really just \"let's see what soap operatically happens this week\" and oh, the Cylons are involved through flashbacks.  The Cylon \"babe\" that keeps nailing the other guy pretty lame, it's pretty obvious that T&A was added the show. Every time she pops I'm bewildered WTF supposed going on. And don't even try bullsh*t about \"story arcs\".  It's soap opera with some CGI thrown-in. This not science fiction aside from the original premise.  This series not everything it's worked-up be. you like trendy, edgy, dodgy, jumpy, vague editor-on-crack camera work, this show might for you. Since nerds seem raving about this show, it's clear indication that vocal nerds' opinions have been changed from Picard's TNG.,\n This movie was hysterical. haven't laughed this hard long time. mean, it's not \"Good Will Hunting,\" but was supposed be? actually went into the advanced screening expecting lot less and was pleasantly surprised. The comedy hits hard and fairly constant. Amanda Peet hot and awesome. The entire audience that screened with seemed enjoying the film much did.,\n Roy Rogers stars Jesse James and his look-alike, gambler man Clint Burns. George \"Gabby\" Hayes Mr. Rogers's ex-pal, Sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are noteworthy team, two reporters the lookout for stories about the elusive outlaw hero.  Of course, mistaken identity impersonation plot development, since Rogers essays \"dual role\". Rogers charming, usual; but, there nothing really elevating this his performance above the ordinary any potential deliver memorable Jekyll/Hyde performance done poor material. The better pair watch are Ms. Storm and Ms. Paye the St. Louis Journal reporters they are the film's highlight. The songs are fine, though badly synched.   *** Jesse James Bay (1941) Joseph Kane Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm,\n saw Page Madness\" silent film course Wesleyan University and haunts still after years. Truly ahead its time perhaps even still this gem film reveals both the frightening and attractive aspects madness.,\n \"The first war 100% outsourced.\" Dan Ackroyd's line says all. This hard describe film; comedy, satire, action, screwball. reminded once twice Dr. Strangelove, especially the scenes featuring Ben Kingsley (who did remarkable job think). had particular expectations this film, though big John Cusack fan, just let the movie wash over me. And result was quite entertained. The political satire painfully accurate and quite damning the military-business complex. The sub-plots were somewhat predictable but the final interweaving story lines made them all worthwhile. can understand why this film was not terribly popular the US, but for the rest the world, timely tale.,\n single woman over 40, found this film extremely insulting and demeaning single women over 40, not mention every other woman, any age. was sad, pathetic attempt man write and direct \"chick flick\", and failed miserably. Andy McDowell isn't much actress begin with, but given the non-existent \"plot\" hate even refer plot) this, she didn't have chance. There was character development, reason feel sympathy/empathy for any the characters, and attempt make the film any way realistic believable. And then there's the obligatory male-fantasy attractive straight woman suddenly deciding give lesbianism try PLEASE.  Not only wish could get money back for the DVD rental, also want those 112 minutes life back. What ripoff.,\n THIS POST MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS :  Although was years after the series ended and was currently working Justice League, this animated movie welcome addition the video library. Why? Well, Mask the Phantasm compliments the first episodes Batman: The Animated Series and SubZero compliments the episodes the Adventures Batman and Robin, then Mystery the Batwoman compliments the final episodes the Gotham Knights version Batman. Kevin Conroy once again delivers voice over performance that nothing short excellence and perfection. admit was bit leery when heard about Batwoman and all could think about were the old 50's comics Batman. But was blown away the Batwoman character, her look, her costume (which assumed inspired Bruce Wayne create the costume Batman Beyond)and the fact that this movie keeps you guessing who Batwoman all the way through. you want know who Batwoman is, then buy rent the DVD. Barbara Gordon makes cameo appearance and think the writers were trying hint that Bruce and Barbara had something going between them like they did Batman Beyond. Tim Drake appears Robin, but his role small one and sadly, there sign mention Dick Grayson alias Nightwing, which leads believe has established himself Bludhaven (his city the comics).  Of the three suspects for Batwoman, favorite Kathy Duquesne, who looks awful lot like Halle Berry. Kelly Ripa did great job one the other suspects. When comes the villains, I'm glad the Penguin was one them, but did not like the fact that they replaced Paul Williams with David Ogden Stiers. Pengy just didn't sound right. Same thing goes for Robin. The new guy did okay, but just was starting get used Matt Valencia, they replaced him. It's interesting note that Kevin Michael Richardson, who voices Carlton Duquesne now the voice the Joker \"The Batman\" series. And finally see what Rupert Thorne looks like revamped since didn't show the Gotham Knights episodes. The late John Vernon will missed. Although enjoyed Henry Silva the voice Bane, had replaced, they got the right man the form Hector Elizondo. only wish they could have used Two Face, Riddler, the scary new version the Scarecrow.  The musical score and especially the soft sounding intro were superb. wish that was soundtrack and especially enjoyed the beautiful and talented Cherie the Iceberg Lounge along with her song, Betcha Neva. While some feel that this movie weaker than the Mask the Phantasm and Subzero, find just strong and enjoyable the rest, plus like said earlier, it's full length movie based off the Gotham Knights version Batman, which think gives good balance. would least recommend renting this DVD first before buying for those who might leery this movie, but personally, it's well worth the purchase. give Mystery the Batwoman,\n Bromwell High nothing short brilliant. Expertly scripted and perfectly delivered, this searing parody students and teachers South London Public School leaves you literally rolling with laughter. It's vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp. The characters are superbly caricatured cross section British society (or more accurate, any society). Following the escapades Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three \"protagonists\" for want better term, the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject. Political correctness flies out the window every episode. you enjoy shows that aren't afraid poke fun every taboo subject imaginable, then Bromwell High will not disappoint!,\n can safely admit (as IMDb geek) that 'Phantom Lady' will never crack into film noir top twenty. may not even sneak into the top fifty. But rather than discredit the film for not being good many other classics the film noir genre, should noted that 'Phantom Lady' has enough strong and lasting images make worthwhile viewing. All that required from the viewer the ability get beyond the dreadfully slow beginning.  The film doesn't get cooking until 'Kansas' (Ella Raines) sets about trying prove all but single handedly the innocence her boss, Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), who has been convicted murder. 'Kansas' Anderson's secretary day and amateur detective night. the novice sleuth she does quite well for herself while working the streets New York night. Little little she starts putting pieces murder mystery puzzle together. honest, the film belongs Raines and only due her presence that the film works well all. Somehow she able breathe life into film about condemned man who not interesting the slightest. I'm not sure this splintered dynamic characterless leading man becomes the fault the actor the director, but clearly this where something becomes terribly wrong with the film.  As interesting Raines novice detective, things really accelerate into another hidden gear when 'Kansas' pays late night visit wandering drummer (Elisha Cook, Jr.) search some information help her condemned boss. She and the drummer paint the town new kind red while visiting the \"all night\" jazz clubs. Trying describe this scene will either prove injustice the scene worse yet, could ruin the scene all together. You'll know the scene once the last cymbal crash has finished ringing out. you're lucky enough have this film DVD, you'll more than likely rewinding this scene again and again. good Raines is, this scene that makes this film noteworthy. mainly because this scene that rate 'Phantom Lady' instead 6.  For the most part this film comes off tepid and bland with few great scenes and one magnificent scene. the 'drum/sex scene' that separates this film from any others the same ilk.  And just like said the film that \"you never wrong with Vanilla\", would also like add that \"going with Vanilla\" the safe fall back choice when one can't decide having tastier treat.  7/10. Clark Richards,\n Three tales are told this film, that seemed have been shot without knowledge this being combined vignette film. The makers relate the three vignettes having them all connected shrink Martin Kove, although you never see some the leads with Kove.  The first vignette has sexy Vivian Schilling, woman afraid everything under the sun(she makes Adrian Monk look brave), having paranoia laced evening home alone. You will literally scream Vivian for doing some ridiculous things. She spends the majority her time nighty which shows off her amazing features. But her film the worst not the most nail-biting.  The second vignette owned Bill Paxton portrays the roommate from Hell. His geeky roommate allows him take complete advantage him, and Bill does whenever can.  The last vignette was funny man fears that death will take him any moment, much like his pal who choked death olive.  Not very interesting, the movie whole seems chopped together with very little thought involved. must for Bill Paxton fans.,\n The people who are praising this film are the real disappointments hoping least that Leonard will see some good out this, his life savings were embezzled away manager couple years ago and he's over now. But this film simply terrible. the beginning Leonard himself says not sentimental about his past, and then for the next hour and half the film emphasizes all the worst sentimental elements Leonard's songs. bloody PRECIOUS with its endless close-ups over emoting singers. Cohen's interview all done lo-fi video closeups and wanted see medium long shot his whole body! couldn't care less about the comments the performers, especially those overblown ego boys Edge and Bono. None the performers this film have done even one song good Leonard's own music and you are thinking about seeing this and you have any doubts all, heed them. This would acceptable PBS special, maybe, for one time showing. But will even hesitate getting DVD this. When the film finally shows Leonard semi-performing \"Tower Song\" it's ruined Bono taking verse. Even the occasional good performances (Antony, Rufus' first number, Martha's The Traitor) are spoiled the context the rest this turgid blabla. Forget this one, and buy Leonard's most recent album you want pay tribute him.,\n deeply related that youth dream represented the hippie movement.The college debate the beginning the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth that movement. The explosion that Daria imagines, represents the fall all social structures and therefore the development all that huge transformation that society suffering through and finally Mark's death anticipates the end that sees for the movement itself. The film will more easily understood back that time life. During the and 70' young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change. One the more significant changes intended was bring sexuality out the closet and think the scenes the desert not represent orgy but the sexual relationship that men and women absolute freedom would perform the hipotetic situation where there would nobody hide from. watched the scene where the couples would throw sand each other and appreciated the magnificent way which depicted the impossibility continue hiding this basic human instinct. Repression was the way 'control' social outbursts that time and that the method police applies stop the students. This society suffers from hipocresy, and that comes clear when the students gain access weapons skipping all fake controls. The dialogue between the policeman with the college professor, who's detained for reason shows part society interested for this youth feeling and part completely uninterested. Presenting flying the more accurate symbol for freedom, the stealing the plane represents Mark inner wish for but his (going back coming back returning (segun)) shows the difficulties come free from these bonds and said, depicts the death the dream these difficulties winning the game. point view film remember.,\n You know, this movie isn't that great, but, mean, c'mon, it's about angels helping baseball team. find the plot line hilarious anyways, this kid's dad says he'll take him back the angels win the pennant (because knows they won't) Kid prays his fake god help the angels win, god helps the whole time (via the angel Christopher Lloyd, RIP) And the end, his dad doesn't take him back and rides off his motorcycle right that kids face. it's hilarious until Danny Glover adopts and it's friend.  I guess the upside that the old lady left alone die with her stitchin' projects and her stories. The real winner here, though, god. Because later got job writer for numerous prank shows.  As kids movie, gets movie about the mysteries blind, stupid faith, and the nature \"god,\" gets 10.,\n Yes know \"talkies\" had just been invented for the cinema years earlier when this was produced 1929 but this film showed that much had learnt about the art producing films.It comes over filmed \"hammy\" stage play with the actors melodramatically enunciating their lines,rolling their eyes, using too many pregnant pauses and using gestures more appropriate silent cinema, which suppose was normal during the process educating them appear more naturalistic screen.The gaps between lines spoken should have been tightened during editing considerably slows the film.It now only interest for Titanic buffs who want see early example this marine accident film.In next chronological order they could see \"Titanic\" (1953) Night Remember (1958)\"Titanic (1997), see how the cinema's depiction this tragedy evolved over the years.There have been many documentaries and films made including the atrocious \"SOS Titanic\" (1979) version which DVD, David McCallum gives the introduction.It was who played Harold Bride Marconi's junior wireless operator Night Remember\"(still the best feature film please read \"Tribute Walter\" comments IMDb under Howard Morley.demon.co.uk)and gave the commentary the series videos entitled \"End Dream\" was well qualified give the narration.Of more interest found was recording accompanied actual photos the 1912 Senate hearing which also the DVD.Actors speak the actual words spoken Lightoller 2nd officer, Bruce Ismay,Managing director White Star, Harold Bride and others including Gloria Stewart (The \"old Rose\" Titanic 1997) whose voice used for one the first class women survivors.,\n Overall, thought very nice movie hate use the word 'nice' it's rather dry but was very beautiful look and the central performances Rupert Friend and Emily Blunt were very strong. What liked most was that despite the gleaming aesthetics the costumes and the settings, all gilded and shiny, this aspect never took over the heart the film which was good, strong writing (thank you Julian Fellowes :D); nothing too flamboyant saturated with pomp, i.e not sensationalised greatly (when Victoria dragged out bed informed she now Queen, well you couldn't get less glamorous hand over the crown). was paced gently and every line the film held its worth.  Undoubtedly the portrayal the love between Victoria and Albert, though somewhat fairytale-ish the face it, was fact slow burning candle and Friend and Blunt did well show how effortlessly these two people 'fitted' together despite the union being initially arranged (my fave bit was when they come home after hunting and Victoria simply hugs her new husband from behind; much said without any words, that's what film all about). Blunt held her own beautifully well, she has face that demands your attention and can't not mention the costumes that she wears every one simply gorgeous. was Blunt would have trouble parting with any them! The rest the ensemble cast all played their roles well, Harriet Walter Queen Adelaide being highlight.  The only qualm have, that lacked sense urgency, event that could have made the movie little more exciting? (It was rather tame) don't know, wanted 'something' happen that would have Victoria draw out some strength and prove her worth little more. When she and Albert argued, loved it, could have done with some more pivotal dramatic moments, though that may just me.  Lastly, the risk sounding all patriotic, did renew sort pride and awe the crown and what takes such position, especially one young. This may part the fact that this film's snap shot Victoria's young life immediately apt what have been writing for one character mine 'The Sword The Scion' but nevertheless, did flag those feelings (for those following book, can you guess what character Victoria aptly reflects?) might have been part the film displaying how ridiculous the government were back those times they didn't seem give two hoots about the poor and dispossessed the nation, which only turns renews appreciation that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were active this domestic domain. made the government appear rather useless nothing much has changed then suppose.  BLOG films and books: http://sempergratis.blogspot.com,\n This movie had mediocrity, laziness, and thoughtlessness written all over it. you are going movie about vampires that has been done thousands times already, then you better damn good job. I'll the first say that this movie just did not cut it. Some scary/horror movies just fail break the mold the \"lets something forbidden and forsaken for the sake fun because all the stories are just lies\" cliché. This one, sadly, was different, and like all scary movies, once you venture down that road there going back.  And the ending? How the heroes the same job over and over throughout the movie, but then mysteriously they get wrapped the moment and cannot the job the end? The ending was very anti-climatic and spelled part which will never watch. Terrible movie.,\n Sunday would not Sunday without action movie, and when you want intense combat, you turn Tom Berenger (Platoon).  Here plays sniper the jungle going after rebels and drug lords. Life's bitch, gets green office type (Billy Zane) help the mission.  The film the hands Luis Llosa, who stunk Anaconda. doesn't much better here, but Berenger makes the movie worthwhile.  Sure, may little long who wants see lot walking through the jungle, but good, tense action when the time right.,\n \"Thieves and Liars\" presents with very naturalistic depiction the levels corruption that affect many Puerto Ricans and force them make difficult not impossible choices about their and their loved ones' lives. The cast excellent, considering that some are non-professional actors; excellent choice that augments the level reality the film. The photography propels the story without intrusion, should this type film. The script captures the idiosyncrasies and attitudes the \"Boricuas\" very deep way. Sometimes feels like you're watching documentary! Watching this film you feel you've secretly entered the real Puerto Rican society and stand invisibly watching implode. loved it!,\n I'm trying picture the pitch for Dark Angel. \"I'm thinking Matrix, I'm thinking Bladerunner, I'm thinking that chick that plays Faith Angel, wearing shiny black leather some chick just like her, leave that one with us. Only get this! we'll without any plot, dialogue, character, decent action budget, just some loud bangs and hot chick shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bike. Fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes, right?\"  Flashy, shallow, dreary, formulaic, passionless, tedious, dull, dumb, humourless, desultory, barely competent. Live action anime without any action, indeed any life. just the way Joe Fanboy likes it, fact.,\n This shallow hedonism and/or social commentary wrapped tragic tale about jealous young woman's scheme drive apart her father and his fiancée. incest just view through the eyes daughter with Electra complex? Who cares? All the characters, except for Anne (Deborah Kerr) are vacuous and vile. Seberg poor agree with the \"boys with breasts\" comment earlier review). The plot plodded. This predictable material was sufficient for about minutes film that unfortunately was stretched over hour and half! you want see great gowns and jewels the Riviera, recommend \"To Catch Thief\" which you will get the added bonuses entertaining story and likable characters.   I like for films entertain me. personally don't really care where film set. Whatever the time place, want good story comedy drama. also want see some enjoyable characters. doesn't hurt can relate them. Poor Deborah Kerr gives typically good performance, and does David Niven despicable role.  The \"2\" rating solely for Kerr and Niven, and for the cinematography the rich color scenes and the murky, foreboding black and white scenes. Unfortunately, all the great cinematography the world cannot salvage poor story with un-enjoyable characters. sow's ear still sow's ear. Consequently watching this mess was serious waste time.,\n Kudos the patience Paul Muni, who spent hours and hours the makeup room each day look the part Zola. Muni was the one the biggest stars the 1930s and wonder how many people today -other than classic movie buffs know anything about it. was giant the business for least decade. could have won the Academy Award for this performance, which would have given him two row, won for playing Louis Pasteur the year before. own opinion that while tended overact bit, still think was one the great actors the \"Golden Age.\" Whatever part played; you were riveted the screen watching him.  Unlike the Pasteur role, thought this story smacked little too much what we've seen the last years: going overboard make Liberal hero. Even 1937, Hollywood couldn't suppress its disdain for police for the military, here making point tell how \"corrupt\" those organizations are. Filmmakers just love when authority challenged and defeated. that regard, this film way ahead its day since we've seen this big-time since the 1960s.  However, must noted the facts support this story. also does not any way diminish Zola's accomplishments social reformer, getting rid certain evils. Good for him! wish they had spent more time showing that, than concentrating one trial.,\n The only reason DVRd this movie was because live Cleveland and Shaq plays basketball for now and I've always heard how awful was. The movie did not disappoint. The best parts were Shaq's outfits. The worst parts were, well, just about everything else. year old son and just squirmed and couldn't look the screen when Shaq started rapping and kept wondering why Max didn't wish for Kazzam fix that front tooth his! But for all it's terribleness just couldn't stop watching it, the story sucked you in, like black hole quicksand tar pit, was hypnotic. But was worth for the laughs and just say that actually watched \"Kazzam\".,\n Rarely have witnessed such gratuitous waste talent. There almost nothing constructive said about this hopeless swamp film. What few interesting strands the film seems promise initially turn out little more than red herrings. Actors stature Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. are deployed roles which nowhere; director occasional genius produces film which looks like filmed through coffee-stained camera lens; writer (John Grisham) who has never produced anything merit, discovers new depths under-motivated incoherence. The film has cheap, lecherous feel about but barely the level commentary its really part the aesthetic. Normally, come the IMDb write balanced, generally appreciative comments. This egregious disaster film just makes want produce endless, bilious rant. won't, but only because longer want occupy \"mind\" with this trash.,\n stunning film high quality.  Apparently based true events which, told, has the clear ring truth about it, this movie highly emotional and deeply moving.  An abused and neglected child often becomes wayward adulthood, one life's failures, gangster, drug addict burden society.  Antwone Fisher young adult the navy, troubled. the brink being loser. counselled therapy psychiatrist and that relationship which takes center stage the play.  In flash-backs and therapy the source and remedies Antwones angst are revealed.  Outstanding performances from the whole cast. The story effect family tragedy with emotional and physical torment. All the actors give full blooded performances with conviction and realism.  One message from the movie the importance raising children decently.  The real Antwone deserves success. have endured wickedness child but rise above that, shows magnificent character.  And all those out there who have endured such torment but have survived and succeeded: you are all winners. out 10.,\n There are few comedies like this, where almost every line and every character come close flawless. This soooo funny!! And has quite bit satire there to. Sally Field heading the field truly outstanding actors and does good, not perfect, job with her daytime tv-diva. Sometimes her acting just little broad and over the top, but the time she riot! the same league Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Whoopy Goldberg (who unfortunately has too little here). Downey may not convince entirely comedian and has not the timing right all the time, but struggles with his part which is, honest, the most ungrateful one. But the shining star here Cathy Moriarty Celeste, true bitch there ever was one with more than one nasty secret (you will see the absolutely stunning finale!). Sadly Elisabeth Shue never seems quite comfortable her part. normally like Shue, but here she acts fish out water and sometimes seems different movie. But not something damaging and for the most part she least adequate. Otherwise, brimming with memorable lines and situations, this comedy watch whenever wherever.,\n the ravaged wasteland the future, mankind terrorized Cyborgsrobots with human featuresthat have discovered new source fuel: human blood. Commanded their vicious leader Jōb (Lance Henriksen), the Cyborgs prepare overtake Taos, densely populated human outpost.  Only one force can stop Jōb's death marchthe Cyborg Gabriel (Kris Kristofferson), who programmed destroy Jōb and his army.  In the ruins ransacked village, Gabriel finds Nea (Kathy Long), beautiful young woman whose parents were killed Cyborgs ten years earlier. Now she wants revenge. They strike pact: Gabriel will train Nea how fight the Cyborgs and Nea will lead Gabriel Taos.  Five-time kick-boxing champion Kathy Long has all the right moves this high-speed adventure that delivers plenty action. Also stars Gary Daniels (as David) and Scott Paulin (as Simon).,\n This strange, cerebral, surreal, esoteric film. there such thing \"intellectual horror\" cinema, this film it. started get scared and wish there was someone else watching with me, and barely has plot! I'm going have see this film again multiple times before feel really understand it. you're the kind person who likes \"My Dinner With Andre\" and films Godard, you lot mind-altering drugs, you will probably enjoy this film. Wow.,\n For that matter one the worst FILMS ever made. Plot goes follows. Slog through jungle looking areas for minutes so. Have somewhere and strip. Slog through the jungle some more. Give another excuse strip. Back the jungle. look! There's Tarzan looking guy! Strip, strip. Kill the safari people. Tarzan looking guy has fight scene. Saves Bo. strips. Run credits. Run credits, run.,\n Cheap and mind-blisteringly dull story and acting. Not single good line, not even line bad enough good, and memorable delivery. Even the blooper reel included with the DVD showed how inept the actors were and how little fun any them were having. The esoteric and occult basis was apathetically inauthentic, and the antagonists failed creepy believable. The 'homoerotic' overtones were pointlessly tame and dissatisfying, and were limited young boys caressing their chests while flaccid their boxers. I'm not gay enough appreciate it, but little action might have least kept and girlfriend awake.,\n Elephant Walk (1954) Starring early Peter Finch lord the manor some God-forsaken plantation where there always the danger elephants mad Englishmen, staying out the midday sun and going berserk. Well eventually they do, after the typhoid cholera outbreak, course, and much mayhem ensues. Taylor replaced ailing Vivien Leigh this pot boiler/adventure flick. When the elephants storm the house and trap Liz the grand staircase still get goose bumps. Thank goodness Dana Andrews around save the day. One favorite guilty pleasures. color too!,\n generally more willing open minded about rom coms than many, but this was simply not very good attempt. Its got nothing with comparisons with the British original have not seen, and doubt will. has whole lot with meandering plot, lack chemistry between the leads and godawful performance/character from its supposed male lead (Jimmy Fallon).  Fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo year old and acting decade younger than that. He's supposed teacher you see, and course its well known that school districts the world over love hire individuals less mature than the children they purport teach. The character extremely disturbed and irrational that have doubts whether any actor could have made him likable, but old reliables like John Cusack Adam Sandler might have been able give shot. Not Fallon, who neither funny, nor actor, but appears think both. Not once the entire course the movie you either believe Fallon his role, believe that there any way these two people should, would together. Near the end the movie there scene where Barrymore (who was cute usual but could not carry this one alone its hard have one person romance) tells Fallon that its over, too much has happened, and she's moving on. And rather than feeling bad about the scene, sorry for Fallon, you are actively cheering her finally she does what she should have done months ago. But course the plot mechanics won't allow that the end (an end which actually might have made statement out this mess), and instead get see the rational career girl throwing all away chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions. Its course meant gooey and satisfying, but actually made more disgusted than anything else.,\n Director/star Clint Eastwood's \"Sudden Impact\" intriguing addition the \"Dirty Harry\" series combination crude film-making and genius. It's mediocre and silly parts, brilliant and classic others, with compelling, gripping pacing. There are numerous echoes the first film here the shoot 'em \"Make day\" scene recalls the \"Do you feel lucky\" one, one the villains viscerally repugnant the first film's Scorpio, actor who played minor baddie the first one returns here Harry's partner just name few.  Harry Callahan still odds with the higher-ups the department, still mean, still tough, but now he's older and wearier. His constant conflicts with his superiors are metaphor for his inner conflict respect and reverence for the law versus desire serve the pure spirit justice, the two things not always being compatible. This \"incompatibility\" the underlying theme the series. The first film posed simple question, \"What about the victim's rights?\" (do they outweigh those the criminal? Vice versa? Depends?). That film's answer was controversial, prompting sequel (the highly enjoyable \"Magnum Force\") which set out draw the line between Harry's brand justice and pure, heartless vigilantism. Dirty Harry, like many Clint's other roles, the personification vengeance, the protector the the defenseless. This movie however brings back the victim, this case Jennifer (portrayed Sondra Locke), who decides avenge the rape herself and her now-incapacitated sister ruthlessly hunting down and ritualistically executing the men (and one woman) who committed the crime.  Without going into play-by-play the whole movie, will say this mentioned earlier that \"Sudden Impact\" echoes the first film actually also sprinkles little references and in-jokes from the whole series (the confusion concerning the captain's last name example intentional prank, believe). The relationship between Callahan and Jennifer neat has our rogue cop hero found soul-mate this lady vigilante? And she vigilante victim justifiably standing for her and her sister's tarnished rights? The exchange between these two the very end the film poetic denouement the series, one which personally (as fan) found quite moving. That last scene alone makes Sudden Impact the legitimate climax the \"Dirty Harry\" collection, the perfect answer the conflict posed the first film. (Not knock \"The Dead Pool\" that excellent movie was relatively light-hearted suspenseful yet comic thriller featuring Harry Callahan, rather than character-defining film like this one).  This movie did well the theaters audiences the Reagan Era found Harry and his ilk quite appealing, and the President himself frequently quoted \"Go ahead, make day.\",\n Following car accident, mad scientist(Jason Evers) keeps the head his fiancee(Virgina Leith)alive. then goes the prowl looking for the perfect body make her whole again. Pretty lame all the way around, nothing redeeming here. Also the cast are: Leslie Daniels, Bonnie Sharie and Bruce Brighton. Someone should have helped put this one out its misery. Let die.,\n wife, Kate and absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one (hopefully there sequel!). would love know what the catchy song called and who wrote it, maybe because \"old and grey\" and still interested life:-). anyone has the full lyrics please send them.  Of course one big reason why wife and liked this series much was that are years old and retired but still very active intellectually. It's great see show that highlights the contribution society that can still made older people with special skills and experience. The human interest aspect showing the interactions the characters and the younger people around them important part the show.  This series highly entertaining and very sophisticated, par with some our other favourites, \"Spooks\" and \"Hustle\".,\n There story (possibly apocryphal) about exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam the start Twelve Monkeys. Gilliam (allegedly) produced long list (think about the aircraft one from the Fifth Element) and handed Butch Bruce. was entitled \"Things Bruce Willis Does When Acts\". ended with simple message saying: \"please don't any the above movie\".  There fact about this movie (definitely true). Gilliam didn't have hand the writing.  I would contend that these two factors played huge role creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success that The Twelve Monkeys.  Visually, the Twelve Monkeys all that have rightly come expect from Gilliam film. also full Gilliamesque surrealism and general (but magnificent) strangeness. Gilliam delights wrong-footing his audience. Although the ending the Twelve Monkeys will surprise one who has sat through the first real, Gilliam borrows heavily from Kafka the clockwork, bureaucratic relentless movement the characters towards their fate. this journey, and the character developments they undergo, which unsettles.  I love Gilliam films (Brazil, particular). But they all tend suffer from the same weakness. seems have many ideas, and much enthusiasm, that his films almost invariably end tangled mess (Brazil, particular). still maintain that Brazil Gilliam's tour force, but there's denying that The Twelve Monkey's breath fresh air the tight-plotting department. Style, substance and form seem merge way not usually seen from the ex-Python.  Whatever the truth the rumour above, Gilliam also manages get first rate (and very atypical) performance out the bald one. Bruce excellent this film, are all the cast, particularly suitably bonkers and very scary Brad Pitt.  It's been over decade since this film was released. When watched again, realised that hadn't really aged. had changed, course. And this made look the film with fresh eyes. This seems fitting tribute film that, partly least, about reflections mirrors, altered perspectives and the absurd one-way journey through time that all make. first rate film. 8/10.,\n This movie was good.

The bar was not set that high, the fact that expectations were met not saying much.  The Good: The city New York. you live the city like me, you'll recognize certain places and understand that the city supposed more than just setting, rather one the main characters. There are genuinely tender moments, humorous conversations, and plot twists left and right which all keep things interesting.  The Bad: The first thing thought after leaving the theater was that wanted more, but not the positive \"leave them wanting more\" fashion. Certainly the good skits/scenes outweigh the bad, but there are lot skits that fall within the \"in-between\" category, too many fact, which what ultimately brings the movie down. Also, New York City's diversity, though hinted though the many distant pans the city and mentioned conversation throughout the movie, never really realized analyzed the point doing the city justice. For example, many the skits involve well middle aged whites. mean know the city home many the said demographic but come on, Paris Je'taime's plot and character diversity makes New York City look like Lancaster, PA, someplace really white. just disappointing see the city shortchanged its heritage like that.  Still, even after having said this, would recommend giving New York, Love You view. Who knows, maybe you'll disagree with opinion and maybe you won't. You will never know until you see for yourself. This review not meant deter anyone from watching this movie, everyone's opinion art differs. I'm just giving you very vague heads what expect.,\n Debut?

There should re-make for this very nice movie.,\n Frank McCarthy who produced the Academy Award winning biographical film Patton follows with strong tribute another America's fighting generals, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives strong characterization the man, his genius well his egotism. With MacArthur you never knew quite where one began and the other left off and too many times they blended.  The whole story Douglas MacArthur would six hour film mini-series. would cover him from his days frontier posts with his family his time West Point where still has the highest scholastic average ever achieved cadet. would talk about his service the Phillipines young officer, his legend building bravery the battlefields World War France. would also have tell about him firing the Bonus Marchers World War veterans 1932, probably putting the final kabosh any chances President Herbert Hoover had getting re-elected. During MacArthur's last years and Hoover had penthouse suites the Waldorf Astoria New York City. That must have been subject they avoided.  This film concentrates the years 1941 1952 and told flashback. The film opens with MacArthur addressing the student body 1962. speaks the words the famous Duty Honor Country speech, MacArthur's mind goes back World War and his desperate struggle against the advancing Japanese the island Corregidor and the fields Bataan Luzon. The film takes him through his struggle win back the Phillipines, the occupation Japan and the first months culminating his relief command President Truman.  MacArthur film would not work all wasn't for the portrayals Dan O'Herlihy and Flanders Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman respectively. It's the part the film enjoyed the best, seeing MacArthur and his relations with both these men.  FDR O'Herlihy captures the aristocratic squire and exceptionally devious man that was our 32nd President. Roosevelt was man who got his points across with unusual subtlety and cleverness. Sometimes liked scheming little too much for its own sake, but was the master politician the last century. Note how deals with MacArthur both battlefield commander and potential rival the same time.  Truman Flanders people remember him, blunt spoken man the people who disliked MacArthur's haughtiness from the gitgo. course it's the history books how Truman relieved MacArthur 1951 for insubordination. MacArthur was insubordinate, doubt about it.  Yet could write whole thesis the Truman-MacArthur relations. Along the way need not have ever come crisis. I've always felt that FDR would have dealt with the whole matter far better way had still been president then.  MacArthur was also grandly eloquent and Gregory Peck captures some that eloquence some the orations that made him much legend victories the battlefield. Listen Peck the Japanese surrender, MacArthur's farewell the nation before the joint session Congress, and course his speech the cadets 1962. Watch the newsreels and see you don't agree.,\n This one the finest films come out Hong Kong's 'New Wave' that began with Tsui Hark's \"ZU: Warriors Magic Mountain\". Tsui set tone for the New Wave's approach the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors the New Wave (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Siu Tung, etc.) accepted from then given; namely, the approach such films thenceforth would need more than touch irony, not outright comedy. \"Burning Paradise\" put stop all that, and with vengeance.  It's not that there isn't humor here; but purely human humor, with the aged Buddhist priest the beginning who somehow manages quick feel the nubile young prostitute while hiding bundle straw. But this just humans are, not even Buddhist priests can saints all the time.  When irony last introduced into the film, the nastiest possible, emanating from the 'abbot' Red Lotus Temple, who study pure nihilism such has never been recorded film before. the very incarnation Milton's Satan from \"Paradise Lost\": \"Better rule Hell than serve heaven!\" And can't get Satan's hell soon enough, he'll turn the world around him into living hell can rule.  That's the motif underscoring the brutal violence much the imagery here: It's not that the Abbot just wants kill people; wants them despair, feel utterly hopeless, accept his nihilism all-encompassing reality. Thus there's definite sense pervading the Red Temple scenes that there just might not any other reality outside the Temple itself has become all there the universe, and the Abbot, claiming mastery infinite power, charge.  Of course, fortunately, the film doesn't end there. Though there are losses, the human will just ordinarily human last prevails. (If you want know how, see the film!) Yet there doubt that, viewing this film, visit hell. Hopefully, not witness our own afterlives; but certainly feel chastened the experience and somehow better for over all.,\n It's amazing that actress P.J. Soles didn't become big star after playing Riff Randall, fan the punk rock group the Ramones, \"Rock 'n' Roll High School\". Soles exuberant, you don't mind she's obviously too old still high school (that fact leveled out having all the kids look 24). The movie fast-paced frolic that doesn't cop-out; everything gets blown smithereens the end, and that's just should be. Mary Woronov, innately kinky and funny presence the Nazi-like principal, gets great, one-of-a-kind bit the beginning where Frisbees fly dangerously close her head (how many takes did they use that, was fluke?) and Dey Young very appealing Soles' best, Kate Rambeau. The weakest link, ironically enough, this \"High School\" chain-gang the Ramones. They can't act, they're not funny, and their concert segment goes too long. One Ramones song, Want You Around\", treated fantasy and well captured; other incidental songs are good, particularly rare Paul McCartney ballad heard near the beginning (\"Did Meet Somewhere Before?\"). Great fun! *** from ****,\n This movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made. I've seen this movie for the first time week ago, since then every day see the opening and every time feel thrilled felt the first time heard David Niven uttering the immortal words from Sir Walter Raleigh's The Pilgrimage:  Give scallop-shell quiet, staff faith walk upon, scrip joy, immortal diet, bottle salvation, gown glory, hope's true gage; And thus I'll take pilgrimage )  Do you know why would truism say Michael Powell's and Emeric Pressuburger's lives are thoroughly justified for having crafted such wonderful opening? Because they had been already admitted the Paradise Poets long before they made this movie.  I imagine both them facing trial during Doomsday and saying nonchalantly irate God: beg your pardon, Sir. So, You want know what have done during our lifetime? Well, well you'll see: We've written directed and produced: know Where I'm Going, Colonel Blimp, Red Shoes you think that enough Sir? rather obvious that these two great artists had already fulfilled their duty with God, Nature the Muse Whatever you may call when they shot Matter Life and Death. The fact that other people's lives would justified for their deeds could not apparent everybody, notwithstanding feel life would have meaning had never done anything else that see this movie.  Of course old-timers will tempted say: They don't movies like this one any more. They'll partially mistaken; they didn't make movies like this the past times either.  I've have already quoted Keats here, but I'll repeat his words: thing beauty joy forever.,\n cried heart out, watching this movie. have never suffered from any eating disorder, but think this must very true picture.  Alison Lohman excellent! She expresses these feelings amazingly well. teenage years came back vividly. Anyone who has gone through difficult times child teenager will able relate this movie. recommend you all see it!  The music great too I've now discovered Diana Lorden.  I'm also looking forward seeing Alison Lohman White Oléander, because positive she perfectly suited for the role Agnes.,\n The episodic version Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers plays out deathly slow pace, following Johnny Rico leaving his parents, the (not very attractive) girl lusts for, and joining the mobile infantry. The aliens the show are nothing like the barbaric bugs from the film, instead being squid-like monsters that shoot lasers out their mouths.  Throughout watching this version, was continually amazed just how fruity they've managed make the whole thing. The show concerned mostly with the relationships between the recruits, and the aching, prolonged gazes they give each other through their battle armour visors, with 80s synth pop sometimes arriving *during* the sparse battle sequences which last turning the final few episodes. terms construction, owes debt Top Gun, sharing much terms pacing and content (and all that implies).,\n Only the chosen ones will appreciate the quality the story and character design this movie. Superior ancients that dwell the lands lore far beyond any average human creature's understanding. This movie pulls the adventure genre into unique centrifugal magical force fantasy unto thee mystical crystals chalice. Stories come and go, but the idea for good story think positive, not negative thoughts. create good versus evil battle like never before. Embracing impounding shimmering process that keeps imagination glowing one dimension and out the other. Striking quick flash energy that transports human another world.,\n This great film esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness today's politically-minded filmmakers. film that can easily combine sex, gender relations, politics and art rarity these days. While the bouyant optimism the 1960's can't regained, think can least learn lesson from the film's breezy energy and charm. don't know what those who label the film \"boring\" were watching there's much packed into that never remains the same film for more that min time.,\n This movie was seriously awful. The acting was the worst! was worse than student film. Super cheesy, and think the worst actor was the old lady. first thought myself, well it's old movie. Then remembered that that excuse! I've seen older movies with way better acting and such.  The music was terrible to. was really choppy. The editing was poor (most the dialog was out sync.)  Overall, this movie doesn't even deserve only watched because was bored, and the movie hardly entertained me. was just laughable. dead grandmother's left pinkie toe could make better movie than this.,\n found highly intellectual and artistic every way! felt that the script was conveying all the things feel physically and emotionally when got home from work and watched, it. this tribute cinema the highest form and format.  holy guacamole! how wish those days would come again. tried putting bubble window the side car (honda civic 1984), but the vacuum formed muffin trays didn't quite cut it. also civic, sexual positions are limited and are not supported water bed brilliantly depicted 'the van'.  'the van' the utmost side splitting hilarity and can even substitute for porn you watch some scenes privately.  i highly anticipate that Sam Grossman (the director) has achieved his opus.  Ratings john: ****1/2 Sam: *****,\n This movie very much like \"Flashdance\", you know that dance flick with Jennifer Beals. That film probably the most boring film have ever seen since it's not even bad enough funny. \"G.I. Jane\" much better than that film, but that doesn't say much. Here Demi Moore sweats lot and there's high music and get see her fight and everything, but certainly not very engaging. really think the idea behind the film kind interesting, but the script too clichéd and Ridley Scott can't anything about that. Well, like said... It's better than \"Flashdance\"... (4/10),\n Mislead the terrible lie the cover, \"fun American Pie\", girlfriend and sat front the waiting for comedy... and this definitely not one. You probably won't laugh one time you're not one those Jackass-like ever-teeny minds. It's not even erotic movie, which would least been something, given that it's about sex...  So, what this? The erratic plot deals with guy who wants lose virginity (zero originality, remember \"Losing it\" for one) and his gang friends. The rest the characters (i.e. the girls) just come and for credible reason. Come on, there are even Dwarfs (so simple: \"dwarves are fun ho\"...) The acting very TV-like (as the video look throughout the movie) and definitely amateur the case most the girls...  Awful movie. Amateurish, badly produced, and over all NOT FUNNY. Kids and teens will love watch with friends because the swearing and sex jokes. Other than that, don't even think renting this movie.,\n Written and directed Steve Gordon. Running time: minutes. Classified PG.  It was the quintessential comedy the decade. won Sir John Gielgud the Academy Award. was even featured VH1's Love the 80's.\" And looks just good today did upon it's initial release. Arthur the acclaimed comedy classic about drunken millionaire (played with enthusiasm and wit Dudley Moore Oscar-nominated performance) who must choose between the woman loves and the life he's grown accustomed to. While the basic plot one big cliche, there's nothing trite about this congenial combination clever dialogue and hilarious farce. Arthur Bach essentially nothing more than pretentious jerk, but you can't help but like him. Especially when delivers lines such as, \"Don't you wish you were me? know do!\" He's also delineation from the archetypical movie hero: unlike most wealthy characters see the silver screen, he's not ashamed being filthy rich. one scene, man asks him, \"What does feel like have all that money?,\" which responds, \"It feels great.\" Moore lends such charisma and charm character that would otherwise loathed his audience. And Gielgud simply perfect the arrogant servant, addressing his master with extreme condescension spite the fact that his salary depends him. Arthur one those movies that doesn't try brilliant particularly exceptional: just comes naturally. The screenplay which also earned nod from the Academy saturated with authentic laugh-out-loud dialogue. This the kind movie that, when together with bunch poker buddies, you quote endlessly one another. also looks its characters with sincere empathy. There have been number comedies that attempt dip into drama including the death illness principal star (including both Grumpy Old Men's), but few can carry off because just don't care. When this movie makes the dubious decision knock off the butler, actually works, because genuinely like these people. Why should you see Arthur? The answer simple: because it's all-around, non-guilty pleasure. period which films are becoming more and more serious, Arthur reminds what feels like the movies and just have good time.  **** Classic,\n wife and watch film every night with distractions, and mostly artsy films that require thought. have tons patience for films that are slow blossom. wife has double the attention span that do. All that being said-- this film just plain empty and BORING! went nowhere. Never blossomed. started fairly strong with promising plot...then she bakes cookies...goes Spain....she sulks, she stares....the credits roll. Uneven, full holes, false starts dead ends. FF'd through several extended sequences her just staring off into space. Artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried. Zzzz...... It's like beautifully shot chick-flick that's pretending deep artsy. You never get know nor understand Morvern all. About halfway through you just don't care anymore. just wanted see least one the plot lines develop. Don't waste your time this. I'm shocked scores high.,\n This film has viewed the right frame mind. First, the central father-son relationship makes pretty clear that the film was intended prequel his Wong Fei Hung film \"Drunken Master\" (ideas from this film recur \"Drunken Master II), and not \"Young Master\"; that Chan backed away from this plan and renamed the characters indicates that himself was not convinced the material was coming together properly; and, indeed, the film conveys sense being incomplete; for instance, the romantic relationship around which half the plot turns left utterly hanging the end the film. \"Young Master\", from the same period, also feels underdone, but least all its central threads are tied together the end. This film feels though Chan wrestled with the plot and characters trying find his central theme, only abandon the effort, possibly due time and budget.  Or perhaps the film simply over-ambitious. This important turning point film Chan's career, because commits himself development the central character above all other concerns which why there's such lack kung throughout the film. Chan wants make historical romantic comedy that just happens have kung it. But both the historical element and the romantic element come across little more than plot-twists.  That leaves with the comedy. Since Chan's concern character-development, the comedy largely character driven the conflict between Chan's character and his best friend, argument over girl. But there's plenty slapstick well. Frankly, find the comedy amusing enough forgive the incompleteness the plot.  This film represents effort Chan's part find viable formula that can use and develop over time. doesn't quite work, and Chan would only find that formula after abandoning the historical elements his earlier films, with the making the contemporary action comedy \"Police Story\". But going back view this film still very informative how Chan worked his way through the historical genre, and perhaps why abandoned it.,\n For the attention Chuck Davis and Emefy: saw PHANTOM LADY many years ago, when was not yet jazz buff. There exhibition going until end June Paris's brand new MUSEE QUAI BRANLY, named SIECLE JAZZ, not missed, with special entertainment NINE excerpts from jazz movies, including PHANTOM LADY's famous drums sequence. I've seen Gene Krupa and Elisha Cook almost all their film appearances, and can confirm the following: 1.Elisha Cook was DUBBED the movie. That was some progress, since most his other appearances was KILLED (mainly Howard Hawks's THE BIG SLEEP). Krupa probably dubbed Cook PL. could recognize his style, since had already graduated from the tom-tom used (and abused) the beginning his career namely 1937's Hollywood HOTEL's SING, SING, SING sequence and eventually got everything that was possible from what call French \"la caisse claire\". The sequence from PL, least shown the Museum,is not censored.harry carasso, Paris, France,\n Don't get wrong love David Suchet Poirot. love the series well the movies but enough already re: Death The Nile. Everyone has done this one! know who dies. know why they die. know who the killer is. know how was done. say enough already! Mr. Suchet could have used that awesome talent another one Agatha Christie's novels. will say that the acting all the actors was superb. The sets were terrific and very realistic. especially liked David Soul but was surprised how 'awful' looked. hope doesn't look that way 'real' life! honestly can't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same. Somehow don't think so. thought that was rather brilliant touch whether not Ms. Christie wrote that way. would much rather have that ending then wasting away prison!,\n gave this film 10/10 with some reluctance it's hard praise something that haunted and terrified for years. The sheer menace the woman black's face just pure horror and the accompanying music just worsens the dread.   I saw this when was first when was and really did disturb for years. I'm fascinated the fact that many other users have said this too. many movie reviews about how disturbing terrifying film might but you can believe all those who have posted this board, this really incredibly powerful stuff. mean really like horror films and generally find them quite funny more often than not, but this really menacing and will probably disturb most people. haven't seen since was and I'm tempted watch again but fear might have some sleepless nights. can't quite put finger what exactly, but think it's something with the fact that fear the Woman's greatest weapon and that we, viewers, are just susceptible feel the fear intensely. It's remarkable that other viewers' feelings are unanimous.  I've also seen the stage play, which was excellent production...but nothing can compare this.,\n After finally watching Walt Disney's Song the South myspace, decided watch Ralph Bakshi's response that movie-Coonskin-on Afro Video which linked from Google Video. this one, during the live-action sequences, Preacherman (Charles Gordone) takes his friend Sampson (Barry White) with him pick Pappy (Scatman Crothers) and Randy (Philip Thomas, years before added Michael for his middle name professionally) the latter two escape from prison. During their attempt, Pappy tells Randy tale Brother Rabbit (voice Thomas), Brother Bear (White), and Preacher Fox (Gordone) and their adventures Harlem. expected many these Bakshi efforts, there's mix animation and live-action that provides unique point-of-view from the writer/director that sure offend some people. Another fascinating animated character Miss America who's big-as gigantic every way-white blonde woman dressed skin-tight red, white, and blue stars and stripes who has hold little black man and has him shot one the most sexually violent ways that was shockingly funny me! There are plenty such scenes sprinkled throughout the picture which another one concerning Brother Bear's frontal anatomy also provided big laughs from me. There's also segment woman telling her baby \"cockroach\" she was friends with who left her that was touching with that part seeming tribute the comic strip artist George Herriman. was also fascinated hearing Grover Washington Jr.'s version \"Ain't Sunshine\" heard part the score. Most compelling part the picture was seeing the Scatman himself depicted with his head silhouette during the opening credit sequence singing and scatting song that has him using the N-word satirical way. When saw VHS cover this movie years ago, had depicted Brother Rabbit insolent mode front what looked like the Warner circles with the slogan, \"This movie will offend EVERYBODY\". That ample warning anyone who thinks all cartoons are meant for children. That said, definitely recommend Coonskin fans Bakshi and every form animation.,\n saw this Detroit what must have been its original run. literally rolled into the aisle the theater. was that funny. haven't seen since, but would love to. Where you get copy? Anybody saying anything about being dated overdone are, for money, just bunch poseurs. Each skit either wickedly, erotically perversely hilarious. Each one! There not weak one included. The opening sequence, for instance, which parodies 2001, features gorilla go-go-dancers with pendulous breasts. Felinni would have filmed had the wicked wit... you come this film with open mind and blithely sneering heart, you'll pencil right into your very best list.,\n This the kind movie that wants good but sucks. First thing, what the hell are those punk trying with the school? think the kids doesn't seem realize the gravity the situation. Deker guy say the girl that they under his responsibility when she ask why wants back for them but right after this gives gun the wheel chair dude and wants him alone repair the phone line. Where the responsibility there? understand poor actors must pay their food but why not just give them the money that takes make stupid movie like that give that money charity. yea and none them knows how aim. The stupid punk guy shoots the cafeteria nowhere like crazy. They all want look professional but they all suck. One more thing don't believe that there's emergency exit the school the kids are trying several doors but they all locked. What happens there's fire and the dumass security guard dead? illegal not have emergency exit school. Anyway there's lot more say but would too long. spent some time life watch crap.,\n Sadly was misguided. This movie stunk from start finish. was hard watch because used watch Clarissa Explains All every day Nickelodeon. LOVED her. Then the next thing found she did spread Maxim and she was gorgeous! haven't really heard anything about her until watched this movie accident. couldn't believe she would even let something like this seen with her name all over it. Everything about was wrong but still looked like someone somewhere the team was trying really really hard save sunk ship. Too bad.. hope she continues act and would love see her with real cast real movie.,\n Not bad some are making out be, though obviously pathetic compared the original. opinion Amitabh was great the villain Babban Singh try not compare Gabbar the original they were clearly not going for the same effect. Other than some mediocre action scenes however, the rest the film flawed. Character development was poor and the development the story was hopeless, with many loopholes, and missing pieces information which wouldn't have known hadn't read the back the DVD case. The worst part the movie was the support roles from Nisha Kothari and especially this new dude called Prashant Raj. Nisha just plain annoying from the time her lips first open. for Prashant Raj seriously who this guy? where from and why earth was present the film studio for anything other than serve drinks?. His acting ability zero and has the same tone, dialog delivery and staunch expression every scene, whether action, comedy, even scene when someone has just died. Ajay Devgan was average, least his expressions changed which more than can say for his mistake companion. overall, RGV's Aag worth watching for Amitabh's solid performance, and also very sexy Urmilla Matondkar special appearance.,\n Cute and playful, but lame and cheap. 'Munchies' another Gremlins clone come out from the 80s. I'm not much fan the imitations.  First was the excellent 'Gremlins'.  Then came the very average 'Critters'.  Lets not forget the lousy 'Ghoulies'.  But the complete pits would have 'Hobgoblins'.  Is there more??   Now 'Munchies' for would have fall somewhere between 'Ghoulies' and 'Hobgoblins'. Actually probably found more entertaining than 'Ghoulies', but preferred thst one's darker tone.   From the get-go plays its goofy nature (which it's better for it), but due that nature the hammy acting (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips), can get rather overbearing that you rather just see the munchies running amok. That's where the fun occurs. Mostly light-hearted fluff though, the story mainly centres the munchies (who are either hungry, horny and destructive) whole bunch supposed comical encounters (some moments work) the small desert town couple people are the chase. It's silly, but strangely engaging thanks the zippy pacing. The creatures themselves look rather bland and poorly detailed, they're basic dolls being chucked about. Where their personalities arrived from that they can actually speak... and with attitude.  Charlie Stratton and feisty Nadine Van der Velde (who was 'Critters') were fair leads. Harvey Korman was acceptable two roles. Robert Picardo also pops up.  Amusingly low-cut entertainment for the undemanding.,\n Real cool, smart movie. loved Sheedy's colors, especially the purple car. Alice Drummond Wise And Wonderful Stella. liked Sheedy's reference how her face had gotten fatter. The roadside dance scene brilliant. Really liked this one.,\n This not funny and gory the DVD box claims. really love twisted and wierd movies, but this one really just dull! It's one hour ripped off penises, flying Baby Born dolls and lot rape! think the intention with this amateur sleaze, was make It's-so-bad-it's-good movies, but fails. It's just bad! few scenes are ok, but whole it's mess. you like amateur splatter like this one (Only way better) would recommend Andreas Schnass' Violent Shit and,\n Barman directed Any Way the Wind Blows would sing dEUS song. Anarchy rules over logical and common strain thoughts. The story behind this movie just goes any which way the wind blows. And that can truly refreshing watch, you are prepared and willing that is. Viewers who state that there nothing keep the story-lines together are right. Who the hell that Windman anyway? Still, really enjoyed this movie. Antwerp beautiful, bustling, happening place and Any Way captures that feeling. also captures the silliness, the racism, the bureaucracy, the addictions and the violence that survives undetected seemingly friendly city. The movie entertaining, funny and little shallow. Barman's screen debut will not make heavy impact his music debut. that light some might disappointed. But then again, 'Worst Case Scenario' would subtle subtitle for Any Way the Wind Blows.,\n Josef Von Sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about silent Hollywood and the former Imperial General the Czar Russia who has found himself there. Emil Jannings won well-deserved Oscar, part, for his role the general who ironically cast bit part silent picture Russian general. The movie flashes back his days Russia leading the country's fall revolutionaries. William Powell makes his big screen debut the Hollywood director who casts Jannings his film. The film serves interesting look the fall Russia and imitation behind-the-scenes Tinseltown the early days. Von Sternberg delivers yet another classic, and one that filled with the great elements romance, intrigue, and tragedy.,\n Mordrid terrifying. would not recommend any adult child see this unless they are rampaging murderers already. There much filth this movie hurts yes. Speaking eyes, there are eyes the sky, against backdrop stars. Only the devil himself could have imagined such wicked thing. rented out every copy could from local video stores and crushed them with pound crucifix. That movie should remain locked cellar behind the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting beasts hell. That where this movie belongs. suggest you want some scandalous entertainment, and rent All Dogs Heaven, Angels The Outfield. Those movies are worth seeing. you want commit sin and love terrible movies, you need see Dr. Mordrid.,\n The only reason saw this movie was for Jimmy Fallon, who I've had crush since 9th grade, which was his first year SNL. die-hard Yankees fan, and didn't find the movie painful until the last minutes, when they begin showing clips the ALCS games. had cover ears and make small noises wouldn't have hear that which must not heard, but otherwise was completely bearable.  I thought Jimmy played the role very well, because the character was supposed nervous and quirky, and nervous and quirky guy. know that may not Academy Award-winning stretch, but the movie just light, fun, romantic comedy that actually appropriate for both women and men see.  Jimmy and Drew worked well together, and they had much better chemistry camera than other actors the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie that stupid movie? What?) think Jimmy has positive career ahead him, and thank goodness, because Taxi could have killed it. think Fever Pitch will help him out lot. Everyone needs stop being critical his acting ability because just starting out movies. imagine must difficult, and you look any the other great actors our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc) you'll see that they started off some flops. Busom Buddies? Australian soap operas? Here's wishing Jimmy successful career screen. never wanted him leave SNL but what can you do?,\n admit have weakness for alternate history stories, from ITS WONDERFUL LIFE GROUNDHOG DAY 12:01. Among those greats this little gem. It's pretty difficult get through MR. DESTINY without giving nod appreciation each and every cast member, from the goodhearted James Belushi the murderous Courtney Cox. This movie lacks the gravitas and scale make great film, but it's fine cheer-up rainy afternoon. It's also great rental for inexpensive date.,\n After reading the other tepid reviews and comments, felt had come bat for this movie.  Roeg's films tend have little with one another, and expecting this one like one his you liked probably off the mark.  What this film thoughtful and unabashed look religious faith. The only other film like it-in terms its religious message-would have Tolkin's `The Rapture.'  I astonished that anyone could say the story muddled supernatural. simple movie about Catholic faith, miracles, and redemption--though you would never guess till the end. also the only movie can think whose resolution turns, literally, pun.  As (happily) fallen Catholic myself, know what the movie about, and find sort fondness its ultimate innocence about the relation between God and man. But you are not familiar with the kind theology which the film based, then will right over you head.  As film-as opposed story-`Cold Heaven' not ground-breaking. While `The Rapture' heavy with pictorial significance and cinematic imagery, `Cold Heaven' downplays its own cinematic qualities. There are striking shots, edgy effects, attempts fit the content the form. workmanlike shooting, but subdued. Nor does have dialogue acting put class high drama. simple story that unfolds simply. may seem odd; but the end the mystery revealed. looks ambiguous; but with single line the ambiguity vanishes puff Catholic dogma.  In this regard, `Cold Heaven' has its heart exactly the same sort thing that drives movie like `The Sting,' `The Sixth Sense,' `Final Descent,' Polanski's Pure Formality.' All these are films with trick their sleeves. They may frustrate you along the way, but they have point-an obvious one, indeed--but the fun is, least part, having been taken in.  Still, even seems like little more than shaggy dog story with punch line, worth watching for way directs-and misdirects-you. Try it-especially you are, have ever been, Catholic.,\n \"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition\" yet another 'feel-goody', so-called 'heart warming', and out-for-ratings show that ABC has had the time put together.  I understand the troubles that these families through. For that, sorry. But wouldn't you think that putting four wide-screen plasma televisions, three flat-screen desktop computers, inground pool taking half backyard, and closets full expensive designer clothing BIT too excessive for ANY family? Sure, these families have been through lot. Sure, they deserve nicer things that what they had previously had.  But honestly, the things that Pennington and his crew put into these houses are enough suit entire neighborhood.  Another thing that really irks about this show how and his crew always have something good say about every little thing that relates the family, the family's condition. Telling wheelchair-bound person that she 'so strong', 'very brave' really does get old after while. That may sound rude, but believe me; watch this show, and you'll see what mean.  All all, this show overrated. you want watch it, ahead. This comment just heads-up for what you'd watching.,\n still trying determine whether the previous installment was worse than this one, vice versa. Being that nearly fifteen years since saw this film, the fact that remember little about does not bode well. Perhaps simply because only watched once twice, but doubt it. there was anything worth remembering about this film, you can rest assured would remember it.  At the time this film was released, the franchise was still entering its dying phase, lot media coverage was allotted it. It's never good sign when teenie pop magazines contain explanations the plot basics. One such article had explain that Freddy was left too weak infest the dreams grown humans, decides after Alice's unborn son. far, good, but this the job the writer the director explain the audience. should not left some unrelated publication.  Making use the trivia given part three about Freddy's conception, one could half expect scenes that would lift this joke out the \"horror for infants\" category, but alas, that was not be. goes show the sheer idiocy the American ratings system that piece B'harni-esque garbage like this could get the same rating genuinely frightening piece like the original.  By this time, the franchise could not attract anyone with active career. Fortunately, unfortunately depending how you look it, Lisa Wilcox was there provide quotient competent acting. perhaps she just looks competent comparison the rest the cast. Either way, given that her last role was something called The All New Adventures Chastity Blade, doubt she really had anything else going for her. Even poor old Robert Englund has been better productions than that the past fifteen years.  Given that box office returns were steady decline, and not just for this franchise, the time, one would have thought that the studios would realize neutering their films does not make them more saleable. fact, this particular film, like its immediate predecessor, was neutered that not only did fail attract new audience, both succeeded alienating the core audience that originally supported the franchise. Despite this, part five must given some credit for not having the bright, luminescent feeling that made part four insulting look at.  I gave Nightmare Elm Street Part Five one out ten. trying appeal everyone, the MPAA's idea everyone, succeeds appealing noone. Like parts two and four, one could erase from the continuity entirely, and nobody would notice the difference.,\n This was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 re-make Conan Doyle's famous novel 'The Lost World'. And shows.  The film starts promisingly enough, with ruthless organization intending exploit the lost world and Challenger returning defend the prehistoric plateau, but then things downhill. Everybody stranded the plateau and we're left with feeble, boring, over-length rehash the first film.  The dinosaurs (who are hardly ever seen) are just laughable. Are expected take that cuddly toy that's supposed ankylosaur seriously? And the tyrannosaur seems rooted the spot.  Do yourself favor and get hold the 1925 silent version the Lost World. Unbelievably this age CGI and other advanced effects, the twenties version the best and will remain until somebody finally decides decent re-make.,\n Unlike some comments, mine positive. This movie wraps around the dinner table with group friends, some you like, some you don't. few are related--mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not one smooth, happy with everyone and everything, type life--much like real life. Some story lines not evolve, they just happen. But like true families and good friends, they stick together. The wanna-be parents who are buying baby are such a--holes! You are happy for the ending. Poor Delmar stuck between rock and boulder taking care herself, her mom, her son, and trying keep all their lives together. This does not end with sunset walk house the 'burbs and all are living dream world, but very real life portrayal people living day day, month month. Overall, this good story and great movie!!,\n Ecstasy (1933) (USA 1940) Starring Hedy Lamarr (as Hedy Kiesler)  The world's first glimpse year-old Hedy Lamarr occurs the early moments this 1930's treasure she sweeps across the screen angelic wedding gown. This was the start legendary career. This was our glorious introduction the most beautiful woman ever grace the silver screen.  It Eva's (Lamarr) wedding night and her older husband seems uninterested her romantic advances. She retreats the lonely bed and, beautiful scene, she fiddles with her wedding ring the realization her marital mistake overcomes her. The husband seems more interested neatness and order than does love. Gustav Machaty uses gorgeous camera angles and pristine shot framing capture Lamarr's considerable talent and beauty. With words spoken the early part the film, she able grasp our sympathy, our hearts and our support. that combination that prepared the 1930's audiences for what they were about see the film unfolded. 'Ecstasy' was considered shocking for its time... Some thought scandalous.  She returns home her father's estate and files for divorce. The next day, she wakes with complete sense freedom and happiness. She just has outside and feel the freedom the countryside and fresh air. Eva goes for horseback ride and happens across beautiful lake. And one the most famous scenes film history, Hedy Lamarr became the first person ever appear nude major film. Her frolic the woods and her skinny-dipping adventure the lake were legendarily scandalous. But the audiences couldn't stay away. with many today's movies, the controversy made must-see film.  Eva's mischievous adventure introduces her handsome young man who helps her find her horse, who had run off with her clothes. After awkward meeting, they eventually fall for each other. Their first romantic rendezvous was almost controversial the nude scene, with its blatant waves eroticism. However, Machaty does beautiful work these romantic moments. Machaty creates one delightful moment, when Eva literally seems sink into her new lover, using gorgeous early camera trick.  It cannot overstated how brave this performance was Lamarr's part. Many might have presumed was career suicide. Instead, gained her worldwide fame and caught the eye Louis Mayer, who signed her contract with MGM. There are some truly erotic moments this film, even today's raunchy standards. impossible imagine how they were received the 1930's. Again, Machaty was very clever with his imagery, leaving lot the imagination. But all understand very well what are seeing and supremely well done.  The meeting Eva's former husband and her current lover perhaps inevitable. However, the consequences that meeting are not. The film takes few unexpected turns its final act and all makes for great story and lovely debut the grand stage movie stardom for Hedy Lamarr.  I highly recommend this once controversial, now tame film and urge you seek out its restored form DVD. easily worthwhile, only for the pleasure seeing Hedy Lamarr. But the story compelling too and the direction ahead its time. 'Ecstasy' memorable early treasure.  www.tccandler.com Candler's Movie Reviews!!!,\n what director's intuition can bring material that needs just the right nudge the right directions. Young Mr. Lincoln filled with some 'old-fashioned' values, which retrospect, despite its two-dimensional portrayal, least more respectably done than one might see the pap current cinema. What makes work extremely well does, all its simplicity and grandeur, that its truly great courtroom drama the guise history lesson.   We all know Abraham Lincoln the 16th president that did the emancipation and after the Civil war got assassinated. But the lawyer his earlier years was charismatic, funny the most unexpected places, and true gentleman. He's not some superhero that can wrong (which was Fonda's only apprehension the part before signing on), but figure with possible flaws that are surpassed his innate goodness and clear sight right and wrong.  It's suffice say that John Ford exceptional storyteller almost without trying. Actually, it's lie, does try, but makes sort effortless the studio system; worked independent manner while also pleasing simultaneously Zanuck, was pretty much left alone his own succinct practices \"editing camera\", and not moving around not waver far off from the story. It's this strength conventional wisdom that somehow works hand hand with the material, kind companion piece the full-blooded Americana 1939 seen Mr. Smith Goes Washington (only here it's the law and not politics).   Fonda terrific the lead- his first with Ford- and never lets loose sight Lincoln past the make-up and extra boost the shoes. Fonda's own personality, sense, would Grapes Wrath and Darling Clementine, comes out the character Lincoln. However unlikely might be, there's one else from this period that could have played him then: he's mature and wise, but has the gumption prove himself this case convoluted he-saw-that-but-did-she murder case.  Only little bits and pieces, like that final shot which superimposes Lincoln walking down the road with his monument, and couple small instances during that big parade scene early on, seem pretty dated. far the goals set out with Young Mr. Lincoln, there were all met Ford and his crew and cast; it's not hokey one might think going in, and it's got strong balance humor and genuine pathos.,\n young American woman visits her Irish roots and fends off druid witch who out possess her. Sounds intriguing but after interesting start, got lost and spent most the time wondering where was going. The movie seems dithering two directions are watching the travails the Irish-American woman battling her alcohol problem are watching straight off horror flick about evil witch that returns from the past? The director can't seem decide. The two doesn't seem gel and the end you get nowhere. This could much better done and the story seemed drag towards the end. This was most boring and disappointing.,\n Before start, _love_ Eddie Izzard. think he's one the funniest stand-ups around today. Possibly that means I'm going into this with too high expectations, but just didn't find Eddie funny this outing.  I think the main problem Eddie trying too hard Eddie. Everyone knows him completely irrelevant comic, and all love him for it. But Circle, appears going more for irrelevant than funny, and completely lost places. Many the topics covers has covered before even think recognised few recycled jokes there.  If you buy the DVD you'll find behind-the-scenes look Eddie's tour (interesting places, but not very funny), and French language version one his shows. Die-hards will enjoy seeing Eddie different language, but subtitled comedy isn't very funny.  If you're fan Eddie you've either got this already you're going buy whatever say. you're just passing through, buy Glorious Dressed Kill you won't disappointed. With Circle, you probably will.,\n \"The 700 Club\" has the single most bigoted television program the history television itself. make matters worse, it's been the air since 1966, implying that thousands not millions people are buying into its hate and lies. Headed Pat Robertson, the unscrupulous, megalomaniacal founder and leader the Christian Coalition, \"The 700 Club\" takes from misinformation misunderstanding, broadcasting \"news\" they like think and trying convince its audience that all the world's problems are blame homosexuals, Wiccans, New Age spiritualists, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, non-Fundamentalist Christians, Democrats, single mothers, foreigners, feminists, evolutionists, environmentalists, NASA scientists, and anyone else who doesn't share their fanatical religious views. It's actually the best fake news since \"The Daily Show\" the \"Weekend Update\" segment \"Saturday Night Live,\" since \"FOX News,\" for that matter. course, Pat's always the one who makes each the decisions, saying whatever comes mind and not giving damn who offends hurts. the meantime, continues his part the struggle transform the United States into militarized police state having the Religious Wrong stick their noses everything they can and asking for one donation after another less than measly $100 become member, the way fund Pat's African diamond mines and buy oil from companies reprimanded the government the past for their abuse the environment. No, never mind that Pat was good friends with the genocidal dictators Zaire and Zimbabwe order help him acquire such wealth; it's all for the greater glory God, don't you know? And course, the hosts \"The 700 Club\" are always willing read letters \"written viewers\" they like put it, coincidentally each typed the same format and all the same color paper \"viewers\" supposedly healed various afflictions the said hosts (they claim have \"words knowledge\" come them) but who NEVER APPEAR the program say what happened them. Honestly, how can anyone take show seriously when they're using poor applause recording? should make people wonder why there's studio audience.  The sad thing that Pat's cronies and viewers don't realize just don't WANT realize are the horrible things he's done and said. This guy who agreed with Jerry Falwell that the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks the United States were the result God punishing for our acceptance homosexuality and feminism. Ironic, considering that Pat has twice publicly referred the implementation nuclear weapon the State Department; have little doubt was his wealth that kept him from getting arrested for such statements. His rants against homosexuals, single mothers, and any number sexual practices considers \"sinful\" are interesting, considering was known frequent number brothels during the Korean War. the Bible says, fruitful and multiply, congratulations, Pat thanks you, there's probably number children born single Korean mothers. Then, course, there was the time called for the assassination Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez (not that he's saint, but still). Oh, yes, and let's not soon forget the time this \"crusader for human life\" supported forced abortions China. Very \"Christian\" him, wouldn't you say?  And just case Pat has forgotten, haven't forgotten his little speech that evangelical Christians today are \"being treated exactly the Jews were Nazi Germany.\" Honestly, compare his \"plight\" the horrors the Holocaust almost unforgivable. Speaking which, need mention about how blatantly lied that homosexuality ran rampant among the Nazi party pathetic attempt discredit homosexuals? course, history shows that the Nazis acted toward homosexuals the same way they acted toward Jews. Pat Robertson one the biggest liars history. was Pinocchio, his nose would encircle the Earth.  Unfortunately, more and more people continue believe him every day. This your wake-up call, people; \"The 700 Club\" one the most not the single most vile program television history. It's evil masquerading good; it's wolf-in-sheep's-clothing. It's bigoted filth that tries look clean, pretty, and loving. It's living proof that hateful, dangerous religious views aren't confined certain groups the Middle East. Even those who are not the Christian faith know that goes against everything Jesus taught, and Jesus was appear this \"club,\" wouldn't emulating them. Instead, He'd chastising them did the Pharisees His time and overturning the money bins their telethons did front the synagogue His time. All can say thank God that Pat had chance becoming President; did, he'd the harbinger Armageddon and not the side the good guys.,\n This wretched movie shows that not even some Gollywood's best can salvage true landfill deposit..  I could spend much time describing everything that was bad about this effort, but that would require more time and I've already wasted minutes watching...IT.  Looking now, after Brando's death, shows how tragic the life one our greatest actors had become.  Donald Sutherland? Why?   I have fill more lines get this accepted. have fill more lines get this accepted. have fill more lines get this accepted.  Don't waste your time with this movie. I'm overdue something interesting. Bye.,\n The lead characters this movie fall into two categories: smart and stupid. Simple enough.  Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays hapless, dopey guy who gets arrested for crime did not commit. When tries get financially reimbursed his evil, former boss, the situation gets out control.  While Standa genuinely (but endearingly) stupid, his buddy Ondrej absolute blithering idiot who bungles everything and manages say and the wrong thing every time. Without Ondrej, Standa might stand chance going through life with some modest degree success. With Ondrej, life will never boring, but sure won't without lot headaches!  Ivan Trojan plays Zdenek, evil genius type who degenerates into some Hitler-esquire delusional tyrant. Zdenek and his henchmen try kill Standa keep Zdenek's secrets safe.  I very impressed with the high quality and imagination Czech films. For relatively small country, the Czech Republic certainly has produced more than its share superb entertainment. The best Czech movies have seen are: Peliky and Tmavomodrý Svet (Dark Blue World). you see these two movies, you have seen the absolute best Czech cinema.,\n recently rented this doc, having remembered hearing about from IMDb.com and being intrigued the premise. knew very little about either these bands, but remember hearing \"Not You Were The Last Junkie Earth\" The Dandy Warhols ages ago and enjoying it. That being said, this perspective the doc:  One thing found incredible about this film there need have any prior knowledge either these bands. The director (Ondi Timoner) wastes time engaging the audience and familiarizing them with the people this film. quickly became grooved the lives both Anton and Courtney well their respective bands, The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. think that part what makes this doc good, and what makes Ondi Timoner such master documentarian.  I also loved how the \"story\" these bands was told. Most what you see the bands tour. Both bands start out playing small venues and struggling make the recording industry. Throughout the film, each band strives remain unique and uncontrolled the norm. However this that makes the two bands similar, and thus the brilliant perspective how two bands feather can such different directions.  I would basically recommend this for ANYONE who likes film general. You not need have particular love for documentaries, either the bands. appreciation for music helps, but the music itself takes backseat the love/hate relationship between The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols.,\n Marlene Gorris has established herself one the world's great directors. This sensitive, visually beautiful film based story Vladimir Nabokov and captures well that writer's dark irony. John Turturro gives what consider his finest performance usually not fan his); and Emily Watson brilliant well. Well worth seeing.,\n That's right. movie written, directed and produced Fred Tepper and family. (Fred should have known better, having worked the sets 'Titantic' and 'Dogma'.)   So, the plot. There are some scientists, and some forest rangers, and hot chick with huge fake breasts. They are all really bad their jobs, including the hot chick(who think supposed photographer, but who cares because she wears bikini). One the forest rangers comments that the scientists are \"professional people,\" which good, because would horrible they were professional grubs jellybeans Ewoks.  They are hiking through the woods search some strange ape-like bones, and one even once mentions that the bones just might those the infamous Bigfoot. They just wander around and one the rangers unabashedly hits the hottie. all hope dies real soon (along with his sister who's meant the cute naive one, but really just annoying). Then they, *gasp*, find Sasqu... mean, Ape-like Animal Burial Ground. course, mentions that might just Bigfoot bones they're messing with... guess scientists and forest rangers just don't think about those types things.  Then Sasquatch and his tribe get really angry and kill all the people dislike, chases the other losers away and buries his Great Aunt Muriel and Cousin Josh (who died unfortunate trout accident) all over again.  Insipid, boring dialogue zoned out several times), inane plot, unlikable characters, bad CGI man monkey suit would look better), and acting that just wasn't very good all add make movie won't watching again.  You check out though; it's good for some unintentional laughs.,\n The time the future and for many not aware it, that day now. this final movie for legendary actor, Edward Robinson, \"Solent Green\" becomes landmark classic. Many film buff and environmentalist believe this our eventual history. The movie taken from the novel entitled, 'Make room, make room' but who's working title was changed \"Solent Green.\" The story concerns the Earth evolves into the future with the world's environmental problems becoming nothing short Catastrophic. The planet's natural resources have been exhausted and basic food has been reduced simple staples. They come variety colors, such Solent Yellow, Solent Red, and now 'Solent Green.' However there are those who know the 'real' ingredient Solent Green and cringe their own culpability and fear divine retribution. The first food executive named William Simonson (Joseph Cotton). Upon his death, dedicated police detective called Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston) seeks the truth behind his apparent suicide. Although corruption goes all the way the top, begins with Simonsons' Bodyguard, Tad Fielding (Chuck Connors) and Security chief Donnovan (Roy Jenson) who target Thorn for Waste Desposal Factory. Thorn's boss, Lt. Hatcher (Brock Peters) believes his suspicions but warns him those 'Higher and Hot' who want the case closed, but Thorn will not risk his \"Job\" for easy way out. What Thorn discovers marks him for death, but like the film, awaits final warning. ****,\n youth pastor heard good things about this movie. Then watched it. The acting wasn't the best. That's forgivable. It's the message that's not: Give Jesus your life and everything will change you'll tackle better, make amazing catches, stop fumbling, start making touchdown passes, and even make the playoffs. All because Jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into All-American athletes. laughed out loud when coach quoted scripture explain the kicker why was missing field goals. But wait, that's not all. You'll get brand new truck, $6000 raise, and you and your wife's struggle with infertility will suddenly end pregnancy twice. THEN you'll win the state championship because God helps weakling kick the winning field goal yards further than he's ever kicked before and into the wind, less all because \"God wanted him make it.\" Then you'll win the state championship again the next year. None this good stuff would have happened the team hadn't chosen follow Jesus will all their hearts.  Here's what took away from the movie: God can anything wants whenever wants and it's all about making our lives better, easier, and more enjoyable. chooses his favorite team and helps them win games. Which bible this story based on? I'll bet Saint Stephen wished he'd known the keys such safe life before was stoned death. Someone should have made this movie before the apostles were killed for following Jesus. would have saved them all lot trouble.,\n This movie prime example squandering great resources film. You've got future SNL and SCTV stars their prime, such John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Franken,Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty essentially making minutes coarse, uninspired fart and racist jokes. The concept network from the future subverting society could have really been taken some interesting extremes, but instead right out the gate, makes lame, juvenile proctology joke and stays that vein humor the whole way.Seek out the earlier and much more subversive and witty Groove Tube the later, hilarious Kentucky Fried Movie. This movie only for those who want see time capsule bad 70's sketch comedy movies.,\n This one the most god-awful movies ever. Shaq better just stick basketball. This movie took away apart life will never have back. will make fun this movie until die, and then some. horrible not even funny. MST3000 would have blast with this one.,\n you enjoy films like American Pie, Road Trip Van Wilder; avoid this cinematic refuse all costs. unamusing, mean-spirited, insipid waste resources that should never have been discussed aloud; much less actually recorded and sold unsuspecting consumers. Easily the worst film have seen the past months; mind-numbingly bad for the entire minutes it's runtime. Had been much longer, would not have been able write this review without using profanity. Consider yourself warned!,\n With all the films recent,dealing with the British Monarchy,is really time for another? Answer:YOU BET! The Young Victoria another contribution the wave cinema from Britain dealing with the Royal family. this case,it deals with the early life Princess Victoria,and events leading the Coronation her becoming Queen all England,as well her romance eventual wedding Prince Albert. The film also deals with the tempestuous lives careers both England's Queen Prince,as well several other events that transpire (political turmoil,etc.). Emily Blunt plays radiant Victoria her youth,while Rupert Friend her beloved best friend,Prince Albert. The rest the cast rounded out with the likes Miranda Richardson,as the Dutchess Kent,and the always welcome screen,Jim Broadbent King William,as well cast others that shine screen. Jean Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y.,Loser Love),directs from winning screenplay Jullian Fellowes (Vanity Fair,Gosford Park,Separate Lies). absolutely went out head over the film's visual look (by cinematographer Hagen Bogdansker),who gave each frame film painterly look (with the help production designer,Patrice Vermette),as well some tight editing (by Jill Bilcock Matt Garner). What also appreciated Fellowes' script the use game Chess,as metaphor for some the film's political motivation (the characters the film move about like the pieces Chess board). This smart,well written,directed,filmed,edited acted entertainment (and enlightenment)that makes for well spent evening the cinema. Rated the MPAA for few scenes sensuality,some brief violence little bloody,although nothing too gory),a rude outburst language,and some screen smoking,\n very funny movie. was good see Jim Carrey back top form. was definitely worth the price admission. Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston both played outstanding supporting roles this film. think they may have played the dog bit too much however, still good film see.,\n \"Deliverance\" one the best exploitation films come out that wonderful 1970's decade from whence many other exploitation films came.  A group friends sets out canoe trip down river the south and they become victimized bunch toothless hillbillies who pretty much try ruin their lives. It's awesome.  We are treated anal rape, vicious beatings, bow and arrow killings, shootings, broken bones, etc... lot like 1974's \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\" say that \"Deliverance\" believable would immature. This would never and could never happen, even the dark ages 1972.  \"Deliverance\" very entertaining ride and packed full action. one huge pile exploitation films come from the early 70's and (arguably) sits top that pile with it's great acting, superb cinematography and excellent writing.  8 out 10, kids.,\n long last! One Michael Jackson's most well known and beloved films comes DVD! Michael Jackson Moonwalker, (Michael Jackson) stars Michael. man with powers that are not this world. Michael must save Sean (Sean Lennon), Katie (Kellie Parker), Zeke (Brandon Quintin Adams), and the rest the worlds children from drug lord Frankie Lideo aka Mr. Big (Joe Pesci) who's mission life get all the worlds children hooked drugs! NOTE PEOPLE THE USA LOOKING FOR THIS FILM DVD: Make sure when buying this film DVD you buy Warners Product #WK00817 NTSC Region which plays North American NTSC Region players.,\n watched this movie last night and hoped for the best after watching all the cool trailers.Even the cover the DVD looked good.As soon started watching was thinking like others \"oh God whats this\".There were some moments that were bit creepy but then the mood was ruined stupid music.There was rock and opera during what supposed suspenseful scenes.That right there ruined for and was shaking head thinking damn wasted money again rental and was deceived the cover art.Nothing against the music itself,it was just the wrong parts the movie.Whoever edited the film has clue what they are doing.The cover showed lightning, implying they were caught storm sea.That would have been more interesting but didn't happen. The acting wasn't the worst i've ever seen considering they are all unknown and this obvious their first film.Another reason was disappointed was the plot made sense.In the beginning men saw all the teens get boat,then the end supposedly only girl existed and the others were either her imaginary friends were ghosts i'm not sure because was very badly portrayed. WhyteFox who wrote comment here claims this true story.He she believes ghosts and spirits and says there haunted boat the area this movie was filmed.There was mention this movie about being true story.I have never experienced something like that personally but not saying it's impossible.I guess anyone interested renting this movie,do your own risk.If you like amateur student horror films you may like this.,\n Miscasting happens. Susannah Yorke luminous young Jane Eyre, and her performance impeccable. However, Edward Rochester supposed 35. White-haired George Scott looks and behaves like arthritic 80. Jane's deceased uncle better shape! creaks and snarls, obnoxious and grim. looks like ax-murderer who has sent his out sharpened; we're not surprised keeps wife caged the attic! The great love story looks like sado-masochistic nightmare. There enough darkness the novel, but Bronte's Rochester relatively young, athletic, powerful, and charming when chooses be. has fine speaking and singing voice, good mind, and conscience that unsuccessfully attempts stifle.,\n had been looking forward seeing Dreamgirls for quite while...what with all it's raving reviews, nominations and media attention. And must say, the first quarter the movie was good! really portrayed the black music scene back then. However, the movie wore on, and whole family were bored out our wits. The singing just kept coming, one after the other. mean seriously, just one more music number and would have broke even with RENT.  Furthermore, noticed hardly any character development any the characters; just didn't care what happened them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died drug overdose, knew should have been sad, but just couldn't feel any emotion for that character. The characters were given flimsy background about singing their childhood and whatnot, but there personalities were not revealed enough draw in.  Finally, the conflict was simply not significant enough make the viewer care, which goes along with the lack character development. This movie reminded copy-cat movie based Ray, Chicago, and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies opinion). Overall think this movie would best suit someone who doesn't really care about overall story, yet would enjoy two hours entertaining and fun singing performances.,\n Not totally off the wall good way, but just totally stupid. \"Killer Tongue\" uneasy mixture sci-fi, horror, and supposed comedy. What this equates mindless and totally incoherent film. There very little dialog, mainly due the fact that the script, there was one, complete \"pond scum\". wouldn't even call strange, more like just \"total nonsense\". This movie certain disappoint, and you have been warned. There absolutely reason waste time this, and you do, the pungent smell will linger like rotten fish............................................................... MERK,\n This ensemble piece about adults who return the formulative Summer camp their youth was very quiet entrant and exiter the cinemas the Autumn 1993. I'd say that was shame,but then again,some the better movies ARE quiet releases that don't get much hype praise.  Diane LAne,Kevin Pollack,Elizabeth Perkins,Vincent Spano,Julie Warner,Bill Paxton,Kimberly Williams,Matt Craven and Alan Arkin(who painfully good here) are the group actors who flesh out these roles people who have grown old with good,bad and funny memories summers gone past. This film covers the gambit emotions,mostly pleasant,and the film never hammers away the viewer feel what the characters are feeling,preferring allow the viewer enter into the memories their own. Since movie viewer who bristles bluntly,brazen manipulation films,this something that appreciate from writer/director Mike Binder.  This film's great cheap rent,a good main rent and even pretty sit theater flick. You might run across this TV,and would definitely suggest look-see.,\n was disgusting and painful. What waste cast! swear, the audience (1/2 full) laughed TWICE minutes. This not lie. not even rent it.  Zeta Jones was just too mean believable.  Cusack was OK. Just OK. felt sorry for him (the actor) case people remember this mess.  Roberts was the same she always is. Charming and sweet, but with purpose. The \"romance\" with John was completely unbelievable.,\n Diana Guzman angry young woman. Surviving unrelenting series disappointments and traumas, she takes her anger out the closest targets.  When she sees violence transformed and focused discipline rundown boxing club, she knows she's found her home.   The film progresses from there, Diana learns the usual coming-of-age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez very good the role, particularly when conveying the focused rage young woman hemmed all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism.  The picture could use some finesse its direction all the young actors, who pale comparison the older, more experienced cast. There are too many pauses the script, which detracts from the dramatic tension. The overall quietness the film drains intensity.   This good picture see once, only see the power fully realized young woman whose femininity complex enough include her power. Its limitations prevent from being placed the \"see again and again\" category.,\n see lot movies. Saw the original wargames years ago and loved it. Computers where still big mystery\" for the most and the movie was convincing, it's own way.  This one, however, looks like low budget Wednesday night special. Total crap, from start finish.  The plot weak, you won't believe until you see the movie (which would not recommend the first place). can not point out one actor that actually did good job this movie. But hey, with that script would've been surprised ANYONE could good job acting. Lots cliché scenes. CGI looks like it's taken out the '86 version.  Bah, no, I'm getting bad mood just writing about this. NOT watch this movie.  Life's short waste watching crappy movies.,\n bought this video Walmart's bin. think over-paid!!! the 1940s, Bela Lugosi made long string 3rd-rate movies for small studios (in this case, Monogram--the ones who made most the Bowry Boys films). While the wretchedness most these films does not approach the level awfulness his last films achieved (Ed Wood \"classics\" such Bride the Monster and Plan From Outer Space), they are nonetheless poor films and should avoided all but the most die-hard fans.  I old movie junkie, gave this try. Besides, few these lesser films were actually pretty good--just not this one.  Lugosi is, what else, mad scientist who wants keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through serum concocts from young brides. They never really explained WHY had brides why must women even what disease his wife had--so you can see that the plot was never really hashed out all.  Anyways, really annoying female reporter Lois Lane type without Jimmy Olsen Superman) wants get the bottom all these apparent murders which the bodies were STOLEN! So, she follows some clues all the way the doorstep Lugosi. Lugosi's home complete with his crazed wife, female assistant and two strange people who are apparently the assistant's sons (an ugly hunchbacked sex fiend and dwarf). Naturally this plucky reporter faints repeatedly throughout the film--apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism hand hand! Eventually, the maniacs ALL die--mostly due their own hands and all well. the conclusion, the reporter and doctor she just met decide marry. And, naturally, the reporter's dumb cameraman faints when this occurs. you haven't noticed, there's lot fainting this film. Or, maybe because was such slow and ponderous film they just fell asleep!,\n While Hollywood got sort stagnant during the few years after WWII, England developed very prolific film industry. \"The Man the White Suit\", inventor Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) creates suit that never gets dirty. Unfortunately, this means that certain other businesses are now likely out business! How can Sidney deal with this and maintain his dignity? This example one the great movies which Alec Guinness starred before became Obi Wan Kenobi. It's good look the overall absurdity the business world. you're planning start any kind business, you might want consider watching this movie.,\n What terrible movie. The acting was bad, the pacing was bad, the cinematography was bad, the directing was bad, the \"special\" effects were bad. You expect certain degree badness slasher, but even the killings were bad.  First all, the past event that set the motive for the slaughter went for minutes. thought would never end. They could have removed 80% and explained what happened well enough.  Then, the victims were invited the \"reunion\" abandoned school which still had all the utilities turned on. One the victims thought this was little odd, but they dismissed and decided break anyway.  Finally, the killings were fake virtually unwatchable.  There reason watch this movie, unless you want see some breasts, and not very good breasts that. This movie makes Showgirls virtually indistinguishable from Citizen Kane.,\n Finally got see this classic movie unofficial disc recorded from old VHS, classic piece horror. Its pity more this neglected corner horror terms official releases DVD and VHS ... the horror movie. Recommended for all fans the 70's movie much like trilogy terror. Those interested should get the book the subject David Deal Television Fright Films the 70's. Email for chance see it.....its fabulous see again.  It does have problems like many movies they have rather inventive the effects dept and even mins can seem drag possibly are all used more modern editing but still great stuff and far better than many theatrical frights released today.,\n New York has never looked good! And neither has anyone this movie. While the script bit lightweight you can't help but like this movie any the characters it. You almost wish people like this really existed. The appeal the actors are what really put over(John Ritter, Colleen Camp and the late Dorothy Stratten are particularly good.) ahead and rent buy this movie you'll glad you did.,\n had doubts about another love story wherein disabled individuals find meaning and redemption through honest communication. And it's still not the top list. But the performances from Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and exemplary, almost stunning, and rescue this from being just another tear-jerker. Carter's depiction ALS victim strong, perhaps even overdone times (sometimes her dialog dissolves into undistinguishable mutterings). But the overall effect commendable and rewarding. Branagh may the perfect compliment her performance. <br,\n It's not fault. girlfriend made watch it.  There nothing positive say about this film. There has been for many years idea that Madonna could act but she can't. There has been idea for years that Guy Ritchie great director but only middling. embarrassment all round.  <br,\n This Arnold movie. Now that you know that, I've saved lot you the time would have taken read this review. you don't like Arnold, then you wont like this movie. the case the other, then you will very probably like it. It's simple that.  Now, you're still reading this expect you like Arnold. Good for you! quite good isn't he. The Running Man very typical Arnold feature. It's got the usual retro-future know well from 80's B-Sci Fi, it's got bunch terrible one-liners, lots violence and explosions, and good-looking heroine and happy ending.  In this case, the evil opponent the all-controlling 1984ish government, which uses television effective crowd-control with gladiator-type game shows. Arnold, course, ends one these shows and turns all up-side-down, with little help from his two confederates and the good-looking Amber.  It's not big budget movie, but still managed create pretty good atmosphere the future, with some nice matte paintings and sets help it. It's hopelessly 80's, but find that charming. Acting varying, Arnold doing his usual grunt and shout thing, with helping stone-faced one-liners. Heroine Amber is, put lightly, bit stereotypical, and the subtly named Damen Killian typical evil man.  In spite all it's flaws, the movie shows its message very clearly; television opiate the masses, good way control people. also features some the time futuristic digital video editing, allowing the bad guys change faces video fool their audience. This does not seem futuristic all today, which bit alarming.  If you've seen Arnold movies before then you know when watch this one. Enjoy.,\n This movie introduces quite array characters and their relationships the first half-hour so. None them generate any interest positive response. waited for the intrigue begin, hoping things would get better and ended sticking around until the bitter end, but there was reward for doing that.  If you want synopsis, look elsewhere. the action isn't worth recounting. Not that the story was that bad, guess you could say had some problems with the script--i.e. thought stunk. look the credits will show you that there's pretty strong cast here, used avail. Most the old pros this flick good jobs; the actors hadn't seen much before especially liked Deborah Kara Unger. That's about all that can find good say about this picture.,\n Whale-hunters pick the wrong freaking whale.  A group yahoo whale exploitists capture female and string her her tail-fin. The whale's mate sees the whole thing including the moment the female's unborn baby slips out and slops onto the deck. 'Captain Nolan' (Richard Harris) could tell that the big male really mad the way stared him down say, \"Get out town before high-tide.\"   This story revenge has Harris' presence and Bo's beauty, but not much else. This was Bo's first 'released' film, though her first acting job was four years previous 'And Once Upon Love' released 1981 'Fantasies' (directed John Derek).  P.S. Today, the date this review (November 20), Derek's birthday. hope has 'whale' good time..... get it?..... whale?..... hee-hee.,\n First off there nothing wrong with studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah and other prophetic scriptures. There also nothing wrong with making film such this attempt present the gospel message. qualms with this movie are not either its sincerity aspirations. Christian, though amillenialist, believe there will great tribulation and believe Christ will return said much. even though have disagreement with this film about the rapture that not why rate this movie low.  No, what makes rate this movie low not its sincerity its message, but rather its lack production values, awful script, mediocre acting, and pitiful FX. This movie ranks down there with some the cheesiest scifi fodder the 1950s. No, this movie ranks down there with Plan From Outerspace. This movie failed age well and was probably dated the time they made sequel.  The apocalypse genre film producers could have learned how not make end times film from this, but they failed. The Left Behind Series, The Apocalypse series, and the Omega Code series all failed learn from this because they addressed the problems and the dated look problem, but their scripts are still poor, and their acting wooden.  There are great Christian films, with extremely low budgets, but this film not one them. I'm surprised the MST3K crew never lampooned this one.,\n Here have misunderstood kids who never stood chance against cruel, poverty riddled existence: Robin Hoods singled out the police for persecution because they were trifle wild times. Gad! According this crap Bonnie was the sweetest little thing west the Missouri who was taught psychopathic murderer fun loving boyfriend who didn't really want hurt anybody....he just wanted things without putting lot energy into getting them. Badly acted, poorly filmed, unbelievable dialogue, unrealistic use weaponry, gore that looked more like grape jelly than the real thing. Avoid this bilgewater. Thumbs down. stars.,\n I'm not alone admiring the first Superman movie, film that Richard Donner executed masterfully. also not alone scorning Richard Lester's Superman 2... which brings the Richard Donner cut the same movie, sadly still absolute abomination.  Superman's world one where suspension disbelief required strong doses, but Superman stretches things too far. doesn't matter who directed Superman because the script insults the intelligence first grader. sense there plot because the characters have zero motivation act the way they do, unlike the original superman. With without his powers, Superman's strength (or lack thereof) handled the least believable manner. There too much criticize, will not bother. condemn this movie... perhaps the slapstick the Lester version more appropriate the moronic script this movie based on. Super-Duper bad.,\n Four Eyed Monsters follows the relationship shy, reclusive videographer and equally estranged struggling artist, who, both living the Big Apple, develop unlikely romance with the help internet dating site. This itself not unusual, but what is, their method communication. Foregoing the verbal, they take writing notes and later communicating through video.  The film based upon the creator's (Arin Crumley Susan Buice) own relationship, who besides writing and directing, take acting the lead characters well. With elements avant-garde, anti-plot, and docudrama, the film scatters itself the wind with undecided structure nestled neatly between narcissism and self-indulgence.  As the movie wears on, brief separation and deterioration their once intriguing form communication grow old the couple face the hardship reality. Focusing solely inner conflict, the woes relationship, the film struggles through stagnant narrative that neither original, nor poignant. This could have been easily circumvented with the addition subplot and external conflict, and third act, which there none just montage melodrama that leads nowhere.  What even more aggravating the film's descent from story into reality that abruptly concludes with open ended and unsatisfying finish. This would have been all fine and dandy, but there question asked and meaning discovered pondered.  (On side note, the film contains beautiful animation and vivid and moving soundtrack, one the more interesting aspects the production.)  But always, watch the film and decide for yourself.,\n The film very complete what is, keeping one continuously interested with the flashbacks childhood and growing with such bizarre father, and interspersing with the tails serial murder, one simply cannot wrong. The very plot itself, the very story and essence the film, entertaining. the sort story that the director (Bill Paxton) could much with, and this case, really did lot with it.  From beginning end you are kept anticipating more and more about what happening and where the film going, and the creativity that behind this story first class. felt this film was exquisitely done from start finish, and one those rare gems that seemed without any boring lulls the action flowing neatly, quickly, and tightly from one scene the next.   It demonstrates just how far people can go: such horrible things their loved ones, and such acts evil, the name 'God' when they are disillusioned this case. also sometimes interesting its' twists takes the concept morality whole.  Overall, this the sort film that one easily overlooks, but would recommend you not likewise and check this film out very much worth your time.,\n Horror fans (I'm speaking the over 12's, although you're under apologise for what you might deem insult): short, you appreciate having your imagination disturbed well written, original storytelling, punctuated unpredictable well planted scares, and delivered via convincing performances, then can heartily recommend AVOIDING THESE STEAMERS made directors who have apparently long since past their sell date. It's accident that almost every episode feels were made the 1980's. Not put blame squarely the shoulders some these old boys (or indeed the 80's) because where would without certain movies from the likes Argento, Carpenter, Landis, Dante and Barker (Actually Clive, WTF are you doing there?! Glad see Romero had the good sense give miss I'm sure was asked partake...). More perhaps should point the finger creator Mick Garris whose credentials include the logic defying and depressingly ill-advised remake Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 'The Shining'.  Perhaps indication the state television today. Are starved good horror that applaud any old sloppy schlock that the networks excrete onto our sets? Sadly, maybe so.  Normally wouldn't see the point adding comment that doesn't argue the faults and merits production, I'd just rate accordingly. However, this series woefully lacking any merit (with perhaps the sole exception the theme tune) write this more warning than review: DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. you disagree with then it's more than likely that you haven't seen enough decent horror. Perhaps the earlier films some these directors would much better place start, but these 'Masters' Horror were being assessed these works alone, they'd never have been allowed graduate with even their Bachelor's degree. Unless course they were studying for degree from the University S**t.,\n Yes, this gets the full ten stars. It's plain day that this fill genius. The universe sent Trent Harris young, wonderfully strange man one day and Harris caught him tape, all that true misfit glory that you just can't fake. Too bad ended tragedy for the young man, only alternate ending could written for that fellow's story. The other two steps the trilogy retell the story, with Sean Penn and Crispin Glover the roles the young men, respectively. The world expanded upon and the strangeness contextualized the retelling, giving broader glimpse into growing weird vanilla America. Recommended for anyone and everyone!,\n wasted 5.75 see this crappy movie just want know few things:  What was the point the dog being split half the beginning the movie, the disease had nothing with being split half.  What was the point dragging Karen into the shed, she already totally infected her room, they could have just locked her there where she would have been safer.  Why would the Hermit running around the forest asking strangers help him when could have just asked his relative, the hog lady, take him the hospital?  Why didn't any the characters bother walk into town get help when things started getting bad, are they all really that lazy?  Even Paul was threatened the guy the shotgun for peeping his wife, Paul could have just sent Jeff Bert back the house ask for help. the girl loves deteriorating.  What was the point the box?  Why did Jeff back the cabin after left when everyone else was getting infected, was that big jerk leave the first place wouldn't have just gone back home?  If the police went all the trouble gathering the kids and burning them the fire pit, why did they throw Paul halfway into the river, wasn't even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminated.  Who makes lemonade out river water, that crap has dirt leaves and bugs it. Why couldn't the two kids have just use the tap water, was contaminated too, the stupid ending would still work.,\n wonderfully original romantic comedy that pits the greatest and deepest-thinking scientific minds the 20th century Cupid's helpers. The juxtaposition heart and mind the central theme this light-hearted yet thoughtful movie. You don't quite know how react because part the time you are seeing great scientists silly things nurture budding love, but other times, you hear them discuss some the deepest puzzles space/time our age. The end result fun movie with surprises throughout. Walter Matthau perfect Einstein, Meg Ryan creates quirky, scatter-brained mathematician, and Tim Robbins brings life the contradictions poorly educated working man who fascinated science. All together, they create farcical trip through love and science, mind and heart.,\n The ending this movie made absolutely SENSE. What waste perfectly good hours. you can explain me...PLEASE DO. don't usually consider myself unable \"get\" movie, but this was classic example for me, either I'm slower than think, this was REALLY bad movie.,\n warned!   This crap that other crap won't even deign company with because it's beneath them! Okay, got that out the way, let say something more substantive.  I've seen Ashes Time very long time ago thinking was fresh take the material which based highly revered wuxia tome novel due the emerging reputation the director, Wong Kar Wai. Well, despite all that WKW hasn't succeeded adapting the novel screen according lot wuxia fans; mostly just shots dripping water, beads sweats, legs horses running, etc. couldn't sit through most the movie.  Fast forward many years later when wanted give Mr. Wong's movies another shot after hearing many praises, especially from Cannes. was intrigued his latest, 2046. friend told start Chungking Express because his most accessible movies. wrong! was just p.o. that got duped into wasting time and money this piece pretentious nothingness. Some professional reviewers mentioned meditation alienation and loneliness modern big city, blah, blah, blah. It's all fine the director has point view with something say why these things happen and tell it. But no, merely shows what is. Faye Wong's acting very typical Hong Kong's style: garbled enunciation, deer the headlight wide eye expression, try cute and girlish kind acting; the rest the cast equally uninspired.  I think the word, Auteur, euphemism for director who tries something new and different, which applauded, but not one who hasn't yet mastered the art cinematic story telling, which what Mr. Wong is, for the last years!,\n GOD.. THE WORST SH*T I'VE EVER SEEN -this the main thought which came into mind right after watching the movie. And really not understand anybody with opposite myth. Though, maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable. especially mean the role Graham. What was that??? opinion has destroyed all positive intentions producers. The character was played affected and annoying way. Every time she appears reminds that you' watching movie and destroying spirit the moment, then whole movie because the most time what you can see there are her stupid faces with more stupid attempts create the emotion. TERRIBLE, don't waste your time.,\n anticipated the release the film much any fan the Broadway play. waited and read reviews for months about the award winning performances. mean with the star power Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover... the movie couldn't less than out stars, right? WRONG! was definitely disappointed the finished product. The film did not match the publicity hype was given and the only saving graces were Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson.  Eddie Murphy's James Brownesque performance rescues the movie just when hits its multiple lulls and Jennifer Hudson's performance compels you pay attention each time she's screen. Her performance \"And Telling You\" was the only time that felt the hype was deserved. You cringed she begged her good man let her stay the group and his life. many reviewers have stated, she steals the movie from the more experienced actors and deserves all the accolades she's receiving for this performance. Anika Noni Rose was also strong presence with great voice and comedic talent.   Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles, the other hand, cruised through their performances. Foxx's acting skills for this film seemed predate his extraordinary \"Ray\" performance and Beyonce Knowles was extended fashion photo shoot video taping, posing and shimmying her way through the movie. Her performance wasn't strong enough make you care about her character any point the film.  The movie was too hyped, minutes and song (Beyonce's \"heartfelt\" solo Jamie Foxx) too long.  DH Vancouver,,\n Besides all the technical mistakes ....  How about female flight attendant who's able kill, all herself, out the terrorists (including marines), whom without even using gun. Then, she lands the plane perfectly. We're not talking about Sigourney Weaver Linda Hamilton; we're talking about regular, frightened, yet very well composed flight attendant. How about the leader charge the assault/rescue squad, having full-proof (according the logic the script) plan sleep-gassing everyone and having someone from his team fly the plane. Only decides the spur the moment change plans and instead lead attack the terrorists, guns blazing, not knowing where the terrorists are, how many, and not securing position advantage, that his whole team gets easily wiped out. Yeah, that's using the old noggin. Only later decide use the sleep gas anyway. And turns out useless for all intensive purposes.  Bad this movie was, though, couldn't stop myself from watching and wondering, what next? can't help but imagine all the excellent, unemployed script writers thinking themselves, it's not fair. lol!,\n Much underrated camp movie the level Cobra Woman, etc. Photographic stills resemble Rembrandt prints. Sometimes subtle dialog and hidden literate touches found throughout.,\n love this movie, but can't get what this movie tht not like. People who don't like this movie must Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But can't believe that Mr. Carrey behind all that makeup. And sure that most the actors and actresses the movie has made film before this. And there new face the movie. Taylor Momsen who plays Cindy Lou Who. the opens, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes out hiding. And causes some mean fun the whos Whoville. Sicne know that the whos love Christmas. While The Grinch does not like christmas. And even makes fun little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) who the daughter the town's postmaster (Bill Irwin). The movie was directed Ron Howard. And the narrtor's voice done Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) cast the mayor whoville. Who doesn't like talking about the Grinch close Christmas time.,\n This wasn't the major disaster that was expecting, but that about positive can description the movie. I'm not sure what was meant funny about this movie, but suppose it's all matter taste. Personally, don't find funny watch morons living their idiotic lives making fools themselves television, but then again, I'm not fan Jerry Springer's pathetic daytime talk show. didn't get too bored watching this, but was definitely never enjoying it, either. you're the mood see bad movie, but one that isn't too painful sit through, this good choice.,\n The spoilers this review are offered public service, because the only way enjoy this costume melodrama know that our protagonist, the Lady Barbara Skelton, gets raped and gunned down the end. And not moment too soon. I'd have shot the screen myself but was afraid I'd hit James Mason.  The original 1943 novel, called \"The Life and Death the Wicked Lady Skelton\" guess people didn't whine about spoilers back then), was written woman, English navy brat who was either troubled cynical both. Her heroine devastatingly beautiful, and the author seems think that you have beauty, nothing else matters. But other things matter, such the fact that Lady Barbara's immediate and only response when someone gets her way homicide. She murders three men five attempts. serial femme fatale, she's got case dissocial personality disorder that should have landed her either Bedlam Newgate.   Lockwood plays her narcissistic vamp, wearing much makeup that thought her Restoration-era Joan Rivers (or restoration-era Joan Rivers, ha!). Yet Lady irresistible all three principal male characters-- Michael Rennie, James Mason, and Griffith Jones, all whom good work, does Patricia Roc. course, all three admirers realize short order what psychotic bitch Barbara is, but the plot keeps them all her orbit until one them finally does gun her down accidentally, what meant either irony just desserts. Given the dramatic death scene with boom lifting the camera out through the windows and heavenward, presume we're meant give damn about her death. But hers the first corpse don't care about.,\n There artistic value this movie deserve any award. Well, does not deserve audience well. Ironically, one the awards for cinematography but frankly, the camera movements are disconcerting say the least. Every frame, you feel you are getting the \"full picture\", its like someone \"cropping your view\" from the edges. The story pathetic. Well, will honest, could not bear watch the entire movie. The part that sucked the most was when saw the soldiers partying their barracks and one the soldiers coaxed drink liquor. These and many other similar scenes reminded much Steven Seagal.  Take advice, stay away from this piece crap.,\n Pinjar one the few movies that really leaves mark and makes you think hard. Set Partition India, this film Shows the true reality partition India. Urmila gets full marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional portrayal suffering woman with way go. Her freedom, personal identity and family respect taken away overnight over tragic land dispute. Manoj bajpai simply brilliant her remorseful abductor. There several moments the film where one brought tears. The film points deeply traumatic. Some the partition scenes are spine chilling, yet Urmila's endurance and survival are both remarkable. From woman robbed her freedom woman who gave freedom women similar situations. remarkable film that should given credit for intelligent characters and storytelling.,\n can see why this film was Oscar-nominated for Best Live Action Short, was constructed masterfully. Even you don't particularly like the Blues (though me, this sounded much more like jazz), you can easily appreciate this film. simply very well made, though for the life me, can't see why director Gjon Mili only got direct one film--this one. other words, the film nominated and yet the director didn't get any sort career boost. for the black performers, could understand this not causing their careers shift into high gear, unfortunately most white society have indifference (or worse) for blacks \"that kind music\".  If you watch this film, you aren't particularly enjoying the earlier portion, skip ahead about the 5:50 mark--where picks considerably. When the lady stopped singing and the performers began improvise, the pace improved quite bit.,\n The BFG one Roald Dahl's most cherished books, but this animated adaptation the magic just isn't there. This version remains pretty faithful Dahl's original story one can't lay the blame John Hambley's script. anything the fault lies with the colourless animation, the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voice-overs. One would right expect this story make for happy, vibrant, fun-filled movie..... instead, the film hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious watch. Children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first! All the film will achieve put them off read what actually children's' classic.  Young orphan Sophie (voice Amanda Root) lives none-too-friendly orphanage under the cruel supervision Mrs Clonkers. One evening she peering through the window when she spots massive figure walking stealthily down the village street. The figure realises has been seen, reaches through the window and scoops Sophie from her bed, placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night. Sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped giant from Giant Country, and fears that will eat her. But her relief turns out kind and sensitive member his species who introduces himself the BFG (voice David Jason). The BFG refuses eat people, instead restricting himself foul-tasting vegetables known snozzcumbers. However, Giant Country populated numerous other giants who feast every night, happens poor unsuspecting humans. Sophie and the BFG become great friends, and soon they come with plan thwart the other giants. Together they the Queen England (voice Angela Thorne) with their remarkable story and beg her send the army and the air force fight the man-eating giants. The Queen agrees and begins dangerous operation capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else.  Jason voices the BFG quite well (one the few pluses the film) but his good work almost ruined somewhat poor sound quality. The rest the voice work decidedly uninspired, with very little bring the characters life. Similarly, the BFG the only character that imaginatively animated Sophie lacks appeal, and the giants are boringly designed (and look almost indistinguishable from each other). Even the places are uninventive; Giant Country especially comes short, being nothing more than barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons. minutes the film not exactly lengthy, yet drags quite badly parts due the soporific handling several sequences. Little Dahl's mischievous humour conveyed satisfactorily. One chapter the book deals with the BFG's love \"whizzpopping\" (farting) and laugh-out-loud hilarious. the film, the same section totally killed unfunny handling. came the The BFG expecting lots zest, fun and enjoyment, but what got was pretty much the opposite! This one failed misfire that simply doesn't match the calibre the book any department unfortunately, therefore, must down one skip.,\n Interesting characters, lots tension. close black and white without being black and white. was turned off how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character, quiet, near deaf secretary, was able turn crime ruin colleagues, rough people her way and finally participate heist, and set someone bumped off decoy her own get-away. I'm little put off the trend for otherwise quality movies portray criminals sympathetic way without addressing the injury they've done others other than portray their immediate opponents jerks. this film never know who's money really they abscond with, what happens the innocent wife who the sympathetic deaf-secretary uses set the the sleazy bar owner take the fall for the missing loot. Too bad, the film could have been great.,\n Incredibly muddled, off-putting and ultimately ludicrous (\"the horses, God, the horses!\") thriller. It's creepy times, but has one the worst scripts ever written for horror film. Watch how the final minutes everybody \"magically\" does exactly what the plot needs for the \"resolution\" occur. Bland performances the leads, typically eccentric one Richard Lynch. The video transfer real hack job, cutting scenes half and making the movie even more difficult understand. out stars.,\n This Film was done really poor taste. The script was really bad. feel really sad for the late Gregory Peck who took the title role this B-movie adaptation one history's greatest generals. The movie was politically incorrect and downright insensitive the others who fought the Japanese World War There was scene where almost vomited, showed Macarthur bunker Corregidor island talking the troops like seasoned politician when comes across wounded, one legged Filipino soldier. The soldier bleeding and dying manages sit straight upon seeing the general and says `no papa, mama, uncle sam' and Macarthur gives his little pep talk that Americans `would never abandon' the Philippines. The scene ends with the soldier being invigorated Macarthur's words and gives him smart salute. mean there was more condescending scene portraying the U.S. the great white savior the world please tell because this one takes the cake. showed that Filipinos are damsels distress incapable honor and have rely the great Americans solely for redemption. blatantly and purposely overshadowed the contributions the members the USAFFE (United States Armed Forces The Far East), these are Filipino volunteers that were integrated the military during world war who died side side with the Americans fighting the Japanese, who walked side side with Americans the death march Bataan and defended Corregidor island launching guerilla offensive after Macarthur left for Australia with his famous shall return' speech. late grandfather, Filipino world war veteran and USAFFE soldier was one the many who fought the Japanese with honor and love for the home country. think this movie does not give honor them and the thousands others that Macarthur relied for intelligence preparations for his famous return the Leyte gulf landing.,\n Ever notice how his later movies Burt Reynolds' laugh sounds like screeching brakes?  Must have been hanging out with Hal Needham too much.  And from the looks \"Stroker Ace\", WAY too much.  Can you believe this was based book? Neither could but was. And probably not best-seller, I'll wager.   Burt's another good-old-boy the NASCAR circuit who hitches with Beatty fried chicken magnate with designs his team. Anderson provides what love interest there and Nabors does his umpteenth Gomer Pyle impression faithful mechanic/best friend Lugs.   A lot people here are friends Burt's Hal's. Others must have needed the work. And even real NASCAR drivers get the act, and look have more talent than those with SAG cards.   As far laughs go, Bubba Smith (pre-\"Police Academy\") gets them Beatty's chauffeur. And Petersen, full Elvira mode, gets lots appreciative leers lady who wants get know Lugs real well. REAL WELL.  It's shame that Burt threw away much time and effort film like \"Stroker Ace\" where didn't matter whether bothered act not. They didn't bother write character for him, why bother act?  Two stars. Mostly for Petersen, and for the out-takes the end. Now THEY'RE funny.,\n Not one your harder-hitting stories, and that's real strength this film. There are least two relationships which less confident writers would have added some all-too predictable romantic tension. They not only spare the audience this, but throw some surprises the same time. There are few Disney-ish moments, particularly near the end, but they are manageable. Overall, was worth the rental and was good, relaxed fun.  BTW, you get the DVD, watch the segment where the director teaches you how make aloo gobi. followed her directions and was BRILLIANT! Next time will make the day before plan eat it, because this one dish that definitely gets better with full night the fridge let the spices out!,\n like most people, give free tickets and will and see most things, now that multiplex cinemas are good remember the old \"flea pit\" single screen cinemas and the healthy side 40). England this film was released \"Liar\", it's dog. total waste good celluloid. 4/10 for the photograpy and set only.,\n This second film just interesting the previous one except that there suspense. know what going and what going happen before even hinted the screen. Then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession them. know there will dynamite the car, that will lose wheel, that the car will have crash, just speak the car.

That may baited some dumb woman obvious and has come but know that has already seen through her and that knows being dragged into trap. Now, how going get out it? That's what you must discover yourself. And don't worry will get the main trafficker but how another story. speed boat match our busy beaver the river. also know when going wounded. They did not know what bullet-proof jackets were those days. It's true recently was discovered that some GIs did not have that kind equipment Iraq. But what the meaning such film? This insistence hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that the prohibition that creates the problem. But the film constant and perfect illustration that there value what ever that can stand the way this moralistic crusade against the forces evil.

And why introduce strange new weapon like crossbow that fires explosive bolts?  I see that this movie was made \"only\" days. shows the lack quality.

What waste!,\n text prologue warns that should not allow evil enter our house, but think the more apt word \"entropy.\" Good grief, what slobs these two babes are!  George (Seymour Cassell) alone his San Francisco office and his monstrously expensive home Tiburon while his wife and child are away San Diego. Two girls (Sondra Locke Jackson and Colleen Camp Donna) knock his door, asking directions. Well, it's raining, and they're shivering like two drenched pitiful kittens, and they're not sure the address they're looking for, and, what with one thing and another, George invites them come and partake his pizza the fire. All three them wind George's bath tub and there follows about five minutes mostly undifferentiated nudity double exposure, triple exposure, quadruple exposure, and dodekakuple exposure. They spend the night threesome and the next morning the girls fix him breakfast. But something has gotten slightly cockeyed because Georgie's guests gobble everything down with their fingers and pour ketchup and syrup all over the linen and \"You eat like ANIMALS!\", George exclaims and tells them get out. his dreams.   Now, don't get wrong. Sondra Locke extraordinary looking young blond with cobalt-blue eyes and Colleen Camp bounces around like superball. You gotta say, they breed 'em mighty cute down there Shelbyville, Tennessee, where Locke comes from, and they breed 'em with bodacious tushes too, can't help but note after the first five ten minutes.  But when the girls berserk, does the movie. The film thereafter bathed garish green light. The pair put ghoulish makeup and make gargoyle faces themselves the mirrors. They brain delivery boy and then drown him make sure. They cuss storm and smash windows and furniture. They have one those scenes which two people sit across the table from one another, licking food and then jumping each other's bones.   And Georgie? They first render Georgie unconscious with mace (which contains nothing that you can't find that little red bottle McIlheny's Tabasco sauce your kitchen cabinet), tie him up, pour flour and milk all over him, subject him psychotic trial, put him through one those Tolstoy-type semi-executions, slap him around, dress outlandish costumes, then prance out him and his virtually destroyed upper-middle-class home, and are dispatched delivery van machina.  As for the acting, it's someone had told Georgie, \"First act polite these girls, then act panicked after you're tied up.\" And the girls: \"First act shy, unwilling impose anyone, then act crazy.\" And that's it.   The photography and location work are straight out 1970s porn movie. I'm not sure that suggests total lack skill. takes effort and talent turn San Francisco ugly. The score gives two Leitmotivs. Georgie's some pop tune with lyrics about \"being free\" and \"giving in.\" Jackson and Donna's catchy rinky-tink thing called \"My Good Old Dad.\"   I approve the moral lesson behind the story, though. There are some things you should simply not give to, even though they might look like lot fun first. All very educational.,\n you're watching this movie, you're either Fred Olen Ray fan, you found the $4.99 shelf Suncoast and thought \"what have lose?\", you spun around the video store with your eyes closed and rented the first movie your finger touched.  This movie hysterically bad. It's got everything terrible movie needs: screenplay featuring jaw-dropping dialogue and baffling detours the plot, wacky science involving psychics and other dimensions, continuity that seems travel through wormholes time and space, actors that are not only wooden, but seems border befuddled, gratuitous nudity (not all what you necessarily would ask for), and course, monster played what assume Fred Olen Ray's kid.  Underneath all, however, there something resembling heart Mickey Judy decided get together all the kids the neighborhood and make monster movie (hey! dad can direct it! yeah! can use red paint from johnny's dad's hardware store, and know this ex-stripper who can act it!).  Watch for the blooper reel over the credits you get find out why the final cut the movie was crappy.  Incidentally, Biohazard II...the Alien Force also worth look, but doesn't have the same enjoyably crappy veneer this one does.,\n This dumb movie. Maybe judgment wouldn't harsh the film didn't promise much, but just felt like this movie cheated and played for fool every turn.  I didn't have any beef with the acting, but thought the characters were awful. The movie starts off with Clive Owen's character telling what criminal mastermind is, and how planned the perfect bank robbery, something frequently reminds later. yeah, also tells he's prison cell, although that turns out dumb metaphor. Any idiot knows that the best bank robbery one where minimum number things could potentially wrong, and you're long gone before the police show up. But Clive Owen's scheme requires hanging around the bank for hours for reason but stalk around and look scary far can tell. also has control hostages, negotiate with cops, and most fantastically all, perform This-Old-House job the bank's stockroom and hide out there for week hope brought enough food, and bucket pee in) and then sneak out again. Yeah, that sure sounds like the perfect crime me, Clive! This plan has many moving parts that the only reason didn't fall apart was the screenwriter said so.  And then there are the many unexplained details: Why were the cops convinced that the crooks had accomplices among the hostages? Who the hell Jodie Foster's character, and why she important that she has the mayor her beck and call and she doesn't have tell Denzel Washington her agenda because \"it's above his pay scale?\" How dumb are these cops that they can't figure out one guy speaking foreign language for hours not the sound criminal gang planning robbery? How did the robbers slip away, and why did Clive Owen stick around for week? How did they find out about the bank chairman's past, and the number and contents his safe deposit box? Why the hell would Clive Owen let Jodie Foster the cops? Since when they make toy AK-47s that look real close? How the hell you bug pizza box, anyway? How did Clive Owen manage sneak out secure area the bank during working hours, undetected? Did this dispassionate criminal really feel bonded enough this cop Denzel slip him diamond?  None these questions are ever answered. There are films that achieve depth leaving you wonder about events that happen off-screen, but never felt that way about Inside Man. felt like the scenes that explained these things were cut from the movie, these questions never had any answers the first place, and that's weak. Particularly annoying Jodie Foster's character, who won't disclose what she does, but never seems tire reminding how important she is. We're just supposed take her word for it, guess.  The only reason gave this movie two stars laughed Denzel's \"taxi cab\" and \"pina colada\" gags, and the kid's outrageous video game. Other than that, this movie has redeeming features.,\n The original show was much better. They should have left good note. This movie killed the whole idea. was boring, over-dramatic, and the funny parts were too far between make the slack. This movie really seemed like was trying way too hard serious, and that was definitely not what was wanting from this sequel. Not mention, that for long time was just depressing about the same thing over and over again. So, sorry, Tyler Perry, but try harder next time. This movie just kinda dull, and not that funny either. Sorry. 4/10 stars it.  Jay Addison,\n The pros this film are the astonishing fighting scenes absolutely incredible sword-moves and martial art show off. true John Woo masterpiece. The story tends bit week though, but never overshadows the overwhelming display acrobatic martial art action. you are into martial art movies, you are going LOVE this one!,\n The 4th Pokemon movie made cry when Celebi died. Don't you dare say that Pokemon sucks! don't like when people say that.... I've liked Pokemon for years, everyone should enjoy Pokemon, including this movie and other Pokemon movies. So, without further ado, please say that Pokemon great and should enjoyed people for all ages. And also, why Pokemon-haters give low ratings for all most the Pokemon movies? don't understand.... They shouldn't that.... There's absolutely reason why people should just vote without proving that Pokemon sucks besides the fact that: Pokemon for little kids ONLY. Pokemon stupid. and People shouldn't like Pokemon. think this why people don't like Pokemon.,\n This obscure Sica delivers the goods. And said \"the meek shall inherit the earth.\" This tale classes the surface but really allegory for all the homeless people that populated Europe after the great war. They are homeless but cheerful, societies too impoverished and selfish care for acknowledge them, footmats for the Italian carpetbaggers. Sica chooses tell fairy tale, Cinderella story. have not read the book based cannot foresay the deus machina the construct the writer Vittorio. begins with the words, \"Once upon time...\" exemplify the timelessness its tale, for the story could set anywhere and everywhere. Caricature sketches the aristocracy that cut the bone, whimsical nature the homeless especially when they begin grant their wishes and ending right out Spielberg picture makes this boulange delight for all. Sica's most accessible picture also one his best. Abandoning neo-realism, always dallied between that and pure good old film-making, creates movie that breaks the heart and the same time fills with the yearning hope that one needs continue leaving this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias!!! Gracias!!!!!!!!!!!!,\n What great gem this is. It's unusual story that fun watch. Yes, has singing, but very nicely crafted into the story and very melodic hear. was pleasant watch; enjoyed from start finish!   The movie takes place England during World War II. about apprentice witch who searching for missing portion spell that she needs. She uses her rough \"magic\" transport her and children under her care various destinations find it. They are joined her correspondence teacher, who surprised learn that the lessons from his school actually work!   Although the special effects may seem little dated first, once you get used them they become part the charm this movie. fact, the movie won Oscar for these effects!   The movie innocent and fun and it's hard not like the tuneful songs. The characters are wonderfully interesting watch. think anyone any age could find something like about this movie.,\n God,what idiotic movie!Incredibly cheap with fake special effects(the creature played one guy lame costume)and stupid plot.All dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors(HA!HA!HA!)...they're simply ludicrous.For example have never seen annoying characters like this junk(these dumb kids pregnant woman with his husband and many more).All all,this great entertainment you're drunk.Avoid like the plague.Am drunk?I don't think so...,\n Not bad word say about this film really. wasn't initially impressed but grew quickly. like lot and think its shame that many people can't see past the fact that was banned some territories, mine being one them. The film delivers the shock, gore and atmosphere department. The score beautiful piece suspense delivering apparatus. only seems fair that Chris Young went one the best composers the business. The acting this film somewhat high standard, little wooden some spots, and the effects are very real and gritty. All this high praise for good slasher film book. I've noted some reviews that the film has gotten serious flack having the famous killer's P.O.V shot. And ask: WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT??? classic shot that evokes dread into any good fan the genre and great keep the killer's identity secret. The only thing that stops this film getting top marks book that the surprise twist(killer revealed) not handled with more care, mean just happens kind quickly, though the great performances make just about credible. Aside from that PRANKS great movie (though prefer the original title) and its shame that many people knock off just cheap piece crap. Its more than that, but only few know that seems have gotten lost the haze early 80s slasher. What shame.... Its really good movie people! Believe me!,\n \"Return the Jedi\" often remembered for what did wrong rather than what did right, and that shame, because the last chronological installment the Star Wars saga shining example epic storytelling. manages wrap all story lines the previous movies one grand finale, and does very convincingly.  Yes, there are Ewoks cute and cuddly bears that arguably served broaden the Star Wars demographic and the middle the movie tends slow down bit. But the final hour arguably the best piece the entire saga, where Luke finally comes face face with Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain movie history.  Return the Jedi did many things right that people tend overlook: presented incredible conclusion the Darth Vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible the \"Empire Strikes Back\" very convincing here), exciting opening Jabba's Palace, masterful performance Ian McDiarmid the Emperor, Luke finally coming into his own, the resolution Solo and Leia's romance, and the extremely powerful final moments the Endor moon.  Yes, there are slight annoyances. But they are the annoyances generation moviegoers who've had time nitpick every single scene. It's still magical and moving piece cinema that also serves great final chapter. It's not 'good' movie it's fantastic!,\n This film about Japanese woman who has obsession with calligraphy skin.  The plot absolutely bizarre. fail see any \"sensual\" \"erotic\" undertones. The plot turns ancient art form into fetishistic pornography. addition, the scenes that are filmed Hong Kong are certainly portraying bad parts Hong Kong, such the airport the middle the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the whole film, keep thinking that \"The Pillow Book\" insulting the Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment.  \"The Pillow Book\" perverted, yet boring film. Seriously stay away from it.,\n Firstly, would like point out that people who have criticised this film have made some glaring errors. Anything that has rating below 6/10 clearly utter nonsense.  Creep absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects. The actors are highly believable, the narrative thought provoking and the horror and graphical content extremely disturbing.   There much mystique this film. Many questions arise the audience are revealed the strange and freakish creature that makes habitat the dark rat ridden tunnels. How was 'Craig' created and what happened him?  A fantastic film with large chill factor. film with many unanswered questions and film that needs appreciated along with others like Days Later, The Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch.  Look forward more these fantastic films!!,\n should say right away that checked the spoilers box only because I'm giving this comment the amount thought proportional what this mess movie deserves, and don't want held responsible for some plot point incidentally slipping out.  This comment will take the form tirade for the simple reason that still under the influence this movie, having just watched it, and the unique effect this has renders one incapable the sort forethought and paragraph structure required for coherent, reasoned criticism. That not compliment. isn't the narcotic effect truly hypnotic thought provoking movie. The feelings stirs combine like some uncomfortable emotional Voltron, composed confusing mix some form rage, the vague desire take shower, the rudderless, sinking feeling true betrayal one gets when they realize they have given 109 minutes their lives into the hands someone who would not only squander it, but such pompous, artless way. And probably wouldn't have done anything super productive with that 109 minutes anyway! But even I'd spent something trivial, like power block masturbation and online poker, would have felt more fulfilled when all was said and done.  The problems with this movie are myriad, and better times I'd articulate exactly what they were semi-adult fashion. But keeping with what this movie deserves, think I'll most likely stick the realm masturbation jokes and cartoon references.  The most irritating and terminal flaw that while watching this movie one keenly aware that the makers and participants think they are making much smarter movie than they are. Demonstrating the depth knowledge one could pick one semester survey Western art history community college trade school, the art-jargon piled thick and from all directions, with much supplied talk between our hero, the tortured detective Stan (Willem Dafoe, who will forgive for this movie due him being Willem Dafoe) and his accented antique dealer buddy Blair (Peter Stormare, taking break from playing sociopath for whom murder comes easy playing 2-dimensional plot device movie about sociopath for whom murder comes easy). And talk they do. fact, are dropped into this story crime scene that may indicate the reemergence serial killer Stan thinks killed years earlier, all the back story established partially through unclear flashback, but primarily through stilted conversations between Stan and his dealer, Stan and his colleague, the unforgivably irritating Carl (Scott Speedman). And although differentiate the character Carl (Scott Speedman) from the actor who plays him using parentheses, must admit that very early the film despised this character much that actually found myself sincerely wishing harm the actor portraying him (Scott Speedman). Not anything too fancy. Not death paralysis, necessarily.. But maybe herpes? maybe stage light could fall him and crush his arm? This dangerous digression, but I'm not editing out because want leave anyone reading this who's thinking about paying see this train wreck movie with clear impression the horrible wishes and feelings stirs even the most peaceful man.  Well, I'm sort running out steam here.. over the course writing this the sick feelings this movie brought have subsided, head has cleared bit. Realizing now that I'm still investing time something related this piece sh!t startlingly similar waking after night suicidally heavy drinking next the heaving form still slumbering 200 pound college girl. Your first urge desperate desire flee. This natural.,\n This opinion one the best action movies the 1970s. not only features great cast but also loaded with wild shootouts and explosions that are still impressive today. The story about Vietnam vet (Kris Kristofferson) being recruited his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) help clean the criminal element small town and what happens when Kris starts taking advantage his position and becomes bad the criminals was hired get rid of. It's great seeing Kris play against type. Bernadette Peeters and Victoria Principal both offer great support the respective ladies the two male stars. Jan-Michael shows real movie star persona this film. don't think Vigilante Force video but occasionally shows TV. It's great flick for guys who like movies.,\n Hey HULU.com playing the Elvira late night horror show their site and this movie their under the Name Monsteroid, good fun watch Elvira comment this Crappy movie ....Have Fun with bad movies. Anyways this movie really has very little value other than see how bad the 70's were for horror flicks Bad Effects, Bad Dialog, just bad movie making. Avoid this unless you want laugh it. While you are HULU check out the other movies that are their right now there episodes and some are pretty decent movies with good plots and production and you can watch lot them 480p long you have decent speed connection.,\n It's rehash many recent films only this one has fewer stars, lesser complications and more fuzzy feel it. Abhay and Ritika (played Fardeen Khan Esha Deol respectively) meet friend's wedding where their own marriage (unbeknowst them) begins its process being arranged. Within time the two strangers are married and sent honeymoon camp where they meet other couples going through the motions similar theirs. they spend time together, secrets are revealed, hearts broken and/or mended and love blossoms.  If you've seen Honeymoon Private Limited and/or Salaam-e-Ishq, then you've seen this film. The plot twists are the same, there not single element surprise the entire two and half hours the film. Everything predictable. only enjoyed because had seen 'Darling' (also starring the leads Deol Khan) earlier the day and enjoyed their chemistry that said \"why not\" when sister suggested rent 'Just married' well.  See it: Because Kirron Kher co-stars and her usual darling self it.  Skip it: Because you've had enough all this couple-fest nonsense!   C+,\n Clocking interminable three hours and twenty minutes, \"Salaam-e-Ishq\" pretty but superficial comic soap opera from India that regales with six interwoven tales romantic love (which least four tales too many estimation).  Filmed like cross between MTV music video and Super Bowl beer commercial, the movie sprawling mishmash exotic settings, dazzling colors, sexy showgirls, high-stepping song-and-dance numbers, dream and fantasy sequences, winking character asides, corny dialogue and way-over-the-top comical performances all pretty much standard-issue stuff when comes Bollywood happenings these days. It's exhausting chore just trying keep all the characters straight they dance, prance and preen their way through the incomprehensible storyline.  There's plenty for the viewer feast his eyes here not least all all the drop dead gorgeous women but he'll need the patience Job get him all the way through it.,\n thoroughly enjoyed Man Called Horse when was released 1970, but Return played like typical sequel. Everything about budget, script, plot, casting, and acting was inferior the original. Gale Sondergaard Elk Woman, elder the Yellow Hand tribe, looks nothing like Indian, and neither half the other \"Indians,\" who were played Italians, Mexicans, and Latinos with cheap wigs. And the old guy who played the chief acted more like fat old squaw than fierce leader warriors. even used the bow like woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who did such superb job the original, seems coasting this time around. guess couldn't resist the easy paycheck got for reprising his role Horse.  To fair, there are some interesting moments the movie, such Horse's undergoing painful purification ritual \"find his vision\" and rally the Yellow Hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors, but the whole, Return uneven, boring, corny, and predictable just like most sequels.,\n Probably one the prime examples following suspenseful, dramatic episode (in this case, the superb Balance Terror) with lighter affair, Shore Leave the first true attempt behalf the Star Trek writers produce more entertaining piece sci-fi, and while the formula isn't quite right yet this entry (the true triumph Trouble with Tribbles, Season 2), the laughs come pretty fast long the viewer willing allow for all the silliness.  Diverting from the show's tradition, the Enterprise isn't any proper mission this episode. Instead, Kirk has found perfect planet for his crew spend some time off duty: well deserved break after three months incessant work. The Earth-like planet budget-related fact) very appealing, but only takes few minutes before something weird happens: Dr. McCoy starts having visions white rabbit that seems come straight out Lewis Carroll's work. Soon, other people begin experiencing similar things: woman meets Don Juan-like character, Sulu has run-in with samurai, and Kirk faces double encounter with the past, the shape almost love and the guy who used pick him the Academy. Throw freakishly real-looking tiger, and it's easy see why Kirk and Spock are determined figure out what's going before anybody gets hurt.  The idea classic one: idyllic place turns out far from heavenly. The episode's humorous take the topic rather successful, weren't for dark turn events that doesn't sit well with the rest (of course, everything works out fine again come the end) and the cast's general unwillingness show funnier side themselves (most notably, and ironically, the otherwise hilarious William Shatner). And yet Shore Leave deserves recognition for being another good example the writers trying new, previously unseen things: the definition Star Trek's success.  7,5/10,\n agree with most the Columbo fans that this movie was unnecessary change format. Columbo unique cop with unorthodox police methods. This movie looks like remake any other ordinary detective dramas from the past. And that the disturbing point, because Columbo ordinary detective.  There are two parts this film that left intriguing. First, can't figure out the title this movie. misleading. Maybe better title would've been \"The Vanishing Bride\" something similar. Second, Columbo hides piece evidence without offering the reason (to the viewers least) why does it.  I don't feel betrayed, just disappointed. I'm glad Peter Falk went back the usual Columbo. <br,\n This show not clever. That's basically what boils down to. The \"original humor\" that these writers try pull off avoid completely biting off the rest the worlds bush bashing just unfunny. another comment, someone quotes couple hilarious lines. The standout for was George H.W. Bush telling the kids they're not supposed watch any besides Fox News. Wow. thought the episodes saw were bad. The fact that this line high point for the series pathetic.  My problem with drivel like this sad excuse for political satire that these folks are getting second season. I'm liberal republican and know Bush hasn't been good president. all do. But that's excuse for putting out this utterly poopie waste time. place these writers the same level the geniuses behind 'Meet the Spartans'. Their formula, bite off many already unfunny topical jokes you can and throw even worse original material actually able give yourself writing credit.  Again, just plain bad. Unfunny, and just makes more and more unhappy that crap like this renewed, but amazing and original shows like Arrested Development are canned after solid seasons. Please don't watch this crap, unless you're one those green blooded liberal hippies who think any sentence with the words Bush and dumb comedic gold.   Oh, and the voice Bush sucks. All does slightly emulate Texan accent, and exhale really hard the end his sentences. least South Park admits the voices aren't accurate. you want funny political satire, watch Daily Show/Colbert. look for any political sketches Robot Chicken, which fun watch, since the stop motion action figure animation EXTREMELY well done. Look for the George Bush Jedi bit youtube. Priceless,\n **SPOILERS**KHAMOSH totally unrealistic, lacks plot, and was basically only made see stars portray themselves. The most suspenseful scene the movie was when Shabana Azmi the shower and then see her playing the shower scene from PSYCHO. This movie actually expected users believe that Naseeruddin Shah's character has good enough memory remember where certain shots were fired and how many!  ***SPOILER BEGINS***  At the end, the killer spills his guts Shabana Azmi long enough allow Naseeruddin Shah's character run and shoot him!  ***SPOILER ENDS***  It little humorous (only little) the beginning hear the director and cast members throwing insults each other and hearing Shabana Azmi exclaim, \"Oh sh-t!\"  Overall, baaaaaaaaaaad movie!  Rating: out ********** out 10),\n This could have been interesting Japan-set haunted house story from the viewpoint newly-installed American family but falls flat due over-simplified treatment and the unsuitability both cast and director.  The film suffers from the same problem often encounter with the popular modern renaissance such native fare, i.e. the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves evil for real reason other than that they're expected to! Besides, doesn't deliver much the scares department giant crab attack merely silly as, generally, the ghosts inhabit specific character and cause him her act totally uncharacteristic way, such Susan George seducing diplomat/friend-of-the-family Doug McClure and Edward Albert force-feeding his daughter bowl soup!   At one point, old monk turns the house warn Albert the danger they remain there eventually, he's called upon exorcise the premises. However, history bound repeat itself and tragedy the only outcome the tense situation duly created leading violent yet unintentionally funny climax which Albert and McClure, possessed the spirits their Japanese predecessors, engage impromptu karate duel the death! the end the day, this emerges innocuous time-waster tolerable just minutes but, way, essential viewing.,\n Return the Lost World was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 version The Lost World.  In this sequel, the same five people, lead Challenger return the plateau where group has started drilling for oil which threatening destroy the land. Gomez has something with this. They manage defeat the drillers and the plateau saved, much the delight the natives.  Like The Lost World, what few dinosaurs see are made rubber and these include T-Rex and Ankylosaurus.  John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner reprise their roles Challenger and Summerlee and three the other actors are also back.  Despite reading several bad reviews this and those cheap looking rubber dinosaurs, enjoyed Return the Lost World.  Rating: stars out,\n \"Sleepwalkers\" the first film which Stephen King has written script for. Given this, and the excellent Santo Johnny song that they used the theme the movie, you would expecting odd, and ultimately fulfilling viewing experience. Unfortunately, that's not what you'd getting. The thing is, they could have probably made good movie. The beginning intriguing what with it's small town spooky atmosphere. But something strange happens about minutes into the film. The film turns funny for apparent reason! From that moment the whole atmosphere \"Sleepwalkers\" ruined.For those you who have seen it, who can ever forget good old Johnny screaming out \"COP KABOB!!\" after jabbing the pencil into that one cop's ear?!? But don't get wrong, the humor has redeemiing quality. just rented again see mabye was wrong the first time around, given how original the plot sounded, but was right. Man, what waste. can't believe they got the rights that Santo Johnny song. gave this,\n This one the worst movies have ever seen. However, the little slave girl, Alice and Jared Harris imitating Christopher Walken what makes this movie entertaining. Alice's smoking, drinking and uncanny way showing when her name called strange and interesting. have applaud Jared for his Christopher Walken imitation, and Christopher Walken for allowing this the movie.,\n Okay, let start off saying that nothing this will come surprise anyone who's read the other comments. That being said, G-D, THIS MOVIE REEKED! mean, WOW, didn't know was possible throw much money they obviously did something and still come out worse than ANY Roger Corman movie! Corman was probably pitched this movie some point but declined due the poor quality the script! The only reason this movie got made the first place that someone said, 'Hey, Zombies are popular. Video games are popular. What game can get hold that has zombies it? Resident Evil? No, someone else got there first. Silent Hill? No, too silent. People will never sit dark room just scared silly. Hey, didn't Sega have game where people ran around shooting zombies? They're out the platform biz, could get that for pennies!'  Basically they tried their best make movie that felt like the video game, even down shooting the combat the characters were actually playing the game.  The first and major problem that the original game was horrid. mean,  bad-movie-merchandising-made-into-a-worse-game-in-two-weeks-and-then-shippe d-out-and-bought-by-morons-and-their-parents-for-christmas horrid. The graphics were boring. The monsters were boring. The levels were boring. The interface was boring. The CASE was boring. other words, this was boring game. And that was the ARCADE version. The home version was even worse! With the home version, you didn't even get the shotgun hold your hand while you were being bored silly this pointless game! But digress.  The second problem that they went far actually intercut scenes from actual gameplay during the fight scenes. HUH??? Didn't the editor have enough confidence the effects indicate that there was actual fight going on? Not mention that EVERY fight was shot from the perspective video game, which may explain the tedious use Matrix-style effects. The problem with this that the game was first-person shooter (the player proceeds from the POV the character). Maybe that's why they put the game graphics, let you know that they were alluding the game... Right, whatever...  Anyway, the only thing that made this ENTIRE experience remotely enjoyable was the fact that everyone the theatre was making fun the movie out loud, sudden fits hysterical laughter and general incredulity were taken commonplace and didn't get kicked out.  To sum up, DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE! Don't even deign rent when comes out video couple week. Run. Just run.,\n there was anything Akira Kurosawa did wrong making Dodes'ka-den, was making with the partnership formed with the \"four knights\" (the other three being Kobayaski, Ichikawa, and Konishita). They wanted big blockbuster hit kick off their partnership, and instead Kurosawa, arguably the head cheese the group, delivered abstract, humanist art film with characters living decimated slum that had many its characters face dark tragedies. Had made more independent basis went another studio who knows, but was because this, among some other financial and creative woes, that also contributed his suicide attempt 1971. And yet, the end the day, artist Kurosawa didn't stop delivering what he's infamous for with his dramas: the strengths the human spirit the face adversity. That its backdrop little more unusual than most shouldn't ignored, but it's not all fault Kurosawa's.  The material Dodes'ka-den absorbing, but not ways that one usually finds from the director, and mostly because driven character instead plot. There's things that happen these people, and Kurosawa's challenge here interweave them into cohesive whole. The character who starts off the picture, oddly enough (though thankfully there's not much room for him grow), Rokkuchan, brain damaged man-child who goes around all day making train sounds (the 'clickety-clack' the title), only sometimes stopping pray for his mother. But then branch off: there's the father and son, the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes and with site-specific descriptions his dream house; older man has the look death him, and learn later he's lost lot more than he'll tell most people, including woman who has past with him; shy, quiet woman who works servitude her adoptive father (or uncle, I'm not sure), who rapes her; and meek guy suit who has constant facial tick and big mean wife- those who are social around.  There are also little markers people around these characters, like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night, like clockwork, putting big demands their spouses, sometimes (unintentionally) swapping them! And there's the kind sake salesman the bike who has sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman. And course there's group gossiping ladies who squat around watering hole the middle the slum, not having anything too nice say about anyone unless it's about something erotic with guy. First note with all this how Kurosawa sets the picture; it's little post-apocalyptic, looking not any particular time place (that until couple shots see modern cars and streets). It's marginalized society, but the concerns these people are, however tragic scope, meant deconstructed through dramatic force. Like Bergman, Kurosawa out dissect the shattered emotions people, with one scene particular when the deathly-looking man who has hollow, sorrowful eyes, sits ripping cloth silence woman goes along with it.  Sometimes there's charm, and even some laughs, had with these people. even enjoyed, maybe ironically, the little moments with Rokkuchan (specifically with Kurosawa's cameo painter the street), the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics. But while Kurosawa allows his actors some room improvise, his camera movements still remain they've always been- patient but alert, with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots, painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization silent drama meant weeper. Amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories, with some them (i.e. the father and son the car) especially sad, Kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme his first one Eastmancolor like it's one his paintings. Lush, sprawling, spilling times over the seams but always with some control, this place not necessarily \"lighter\"; it's like the abstract has come full-throttle into the scene, where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath. It's brilliant, tricky double-edged sword that allows for the dream-like intonations with such heavy duty drama.  With sweet 'movie' score Toru Takemitsu (also responsible for Ran), and some excellent performances from the actors, and few indelible scenes whole fantastic career, Dodes'ka-den its own way minor work from the director, but nonetheless near perfect its own terms, which with many Kurosawa dramas like Ikiru and Red Beard holds hard truths the human condition without too much sentimentality.,\n Are talking about the same movie? This movie totally ridiculous, the plot disgusting and completely without logic. Its typical straight DVD/TV-movie including all the necessary ingredients for horrible movie experience: Over-acting has been actors, side steps from the plot that are left unexplained, THE GIRL SHOWS HER T*ts(why, god, why??), people not react things they would real life. I'm not even gonna bother you with details, would take all night. Well, OK, just one: two people were murdered front you you were walking down the street, one the victims practically dies your arms, his blood spurts from his head-wound all over you, would your first concern be; \"Oh, left the world and the last thing saw was angry face!\"? thoughts goes Harvey and his lost career.,\n The appear run the police who all run around armed the teeth and did you know that CID officers change into uniform when they stop work and down the pub! This has got one the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal \"real\" police that has ever been foisted the unsuspecting public. can see that Snipes might have needed the money pay his back tax bill but what the heck good actor like Charles Dance was doing mystery.  Worse than the worse low budget \"B\" film the 50's. hour and half suicide and time will never get back.  Avoid like the veritable plague.,\n New York Love You full love and power. Not for everybody, however, but beautiful movie.  It has the likes Shia LaBeouf (seen Transformers, Disturbia, Charlies Angels, Robot, Indiana Jones, and many more), Maggie Kevin Bacon, Blake Lively, Natalie Portman, and many more. With star-studded cast, this movie without doubt, brilliant.  From many top-notch directors around the world, does not fail impress. The diversity from one story another creative and unique.  It safe say that New York Love You popcorn movie, and should watched BIG TV! This time, trust the IMDb rating, because excellent film.  Eagerly waiting Shanghai Love You 2010.   Watch ILY, you won't disappointed.,\n Superdome one those movies that makes you wonder why was made. The whole plot concerns someone trying sabotage the superbowl, and all the attempts made stop them. How Tom Selleck and Donna Mills' careers managed survive this beyond me. However, the most frustrating thing about was THERE WAS FOOTBALL ALL! Avoid this one possible.,\n Its hard make heads tails this film. Unless you're well oiled and the mood mock, don't view Santa Claus. mixes Santa, Satan, Merlin, and moralizing most unappetizing way. certainly not for fretful children.,\n First off, give you some idea taste movies...  2007 Comedies enjoyed: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades Glory   2007 Comedies hated: Evan Almighty, The Brothers Solomon, Good Luck Chuck  I should have followed first instinct and turned off \"Hot Rod\" after got about the minute mark. knew that point that this movie would not make laugh once. The script absolutely brutal have idea how this monstrosity managed crack IMDb. Any one older than years old who enjoyed this must some kind mental defective.  This doesn't come close anything with Will Farrell and it's clear that Andy Samberg can't carry anything longer than minute sketch YouTube SNL. don't know how they roped Ian McShane and Isla Fisher into doing this movie... they must have owed favors something. came knowing that would dumb movie, but thought would least funny. didn't much smirk.  I don't normally comment movies IMDb, but this was awful, just had warn people. This only the 4th movie I've seen that I've felt compelled rate 1/10.,\n had idea what Jane Eyre was before saw this miniseries. had read and watched many classics before, and believed that most classics were boring, over-worded, and overrated stories with moderately interesting plots best. This Jane Eyre miniseries completely changed conceptions.  Zelah Clarke fabulous actress, and she gives wonderful portrayal Jane Eyre. Her accent delightful and her quiet, yet firm nature matches the young governess' character exactly. Timothy Dalton amazing Rochester. His passion and energy the film makes believe that was born play the brooding master Thornfield Hall. couldn't sleep all the night after had watched this miniseries. The plot both haunting and inspiring. The characters are masterfully performed, and the story incredible. This the best version Jane Eyre ever appear film.  I read the book later and was amazed how closely this miniseries followed Charolette Bronte's writing. Jane Eyre now favorite film and book. you want see masterpiece that will change your life, watch the 1983 BBC version Jane Eyre.,\n ****SPOILER ALERT**** All throughout Australia the summer turned into deluge rain and hail stones the size baseballs that was causing havoc coastal cities like Sydney. It's under these hectic conditions that tax lawyer David Burton, Richard Chamberlain,got involved case, defense attorney, involving the death local aborigine who was found dead outside Sydney bar.   Having five fellow aborigines arrested for Billy Cormans,Athol Compton, death it's determined the police coroner that Billy died drowning not violence even though had bruises his neck and shoulders. Yet the court decided prosecute the five for his death charging them with manslaughter instead murder.  David defending the five gets help from them their defense with the accused assailants opting remain quite and keep what happened Billy themselves and take what's coming them from the court. One the defendants Chris, David Gulpili, begin somehow invades David's dreams want's tell him what was really behind Billy's death.  David first not taking his dreams Chris seriously begins sense that their real when meet him the courthouse. Chris confirms David's dreams showing him strange looking black rock that David saw Chris have his dreams. Later meeting Chris and, what turns out aborigine shaman, Charlie (Nandjiwarna Amagula) who came his house that evening David told that he, like Charlie, has spiritual powers that inherited from his mother's grandfather. Those powers will reveal him the future that has with the strange weather conditions that are flooding the Australian continent. The earth,Chris tells David, going through gigantic cleansing cycle with the old world about washed away and the new world ready take it's place.  David confused about what both Chris and Charlie are telling him but the rains continue increase and the ocean waves start rise feels that something terrible going happen. David want's know it's all aborigine folklore there's some scientific facts, logic, behind their end world-like revelations.  By now it's obvious that both Chris and Charlie are members aborigine tribe right the heart modern Sydney. That alone can get Chris off, well his four friends, for the murder Billy. Since the Australian government will not prosecute tribal aborigines, leaving any justice done the tribes themselves. Still Chris refuses admit he's member native tribe and and his four friends are convicted manslaughter Billy's death with the sentences handed down the judge within days.  David now determined find out what was the reason for Chris' silence, and why Billy had die, taken Chris the scene the crime. It's there that David finds out that Billy betrayed Chris' tribe members going there with Billy not being member Chris's aborigine tribe. It's also revealed David that himself has some kind spiritual connection with the Austrailan aborigines both Charlie and his step-father Rev. Burton,David Parslow, told him.   The stage now set for the great and final cleansing cycle that David's been seeing both his night-time dreams and day-time visions. comes the form massive tidal wave rolling out the Pacific Ocean into the Australian coast city Sydney and then submerges the entire continent.,\n Polanski returns the themes solitude and madness which explored such tremendous effect Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant.  The atmosphere trademark Polanski dark, brooding, unnerving but there something awkward about this movie and not sure whether not deliberate.  Sven Nykvist, who was responsible for some Bergman's most beautiful films, doesn't quite himself justice here. his name was one the things which really attracted this movie, was little disappointed how few instances truly impressive cinematography are the film.  The only thing that really lets the movie down the acting. Polanski certainly not bad actor, but seems have bitten off more than can chew with the difficult role Trelkovsky. Some the supporting cast are great, notably Melvyn Douglas the landlord and Shelley Winters the concierge, but others are weak and miscast. also hard get past the fact that all these supposed Parisians have American accents.  Quite unexpectedly, there are some fine moments dark comedy the film. Anyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski certainly good comedic actor. However, there are moments when slips dangerously close being parody itself. Trelkovsky's sudden (and somewhat unexplained) 'transformation' more likely raise giggles than eyebrows, which detracts from what should have been powerful moment his psycho-dramatic journey.  All all, The Tenant enjoyable and intriguing experience, little too languorous for its own good. There's handful exceptionally chilling moments and consistently uncomfortable and foreboding atmosphere but this film, while being very good, does not quite hit the mark successfully could have.  Alas, the end the day, 'okay' Polanski movie still better than most other 'good' movies. Definitely worth watch, just don't expect blown away.,\n Here's first David Mamet directed film. Fitting, since was his first, well.   The story here uneven and moves along like any con movie, from the little cons the big cons the all-encompassing con. It's like \"The Grifters,\" but without that film's level acting. (In that film, John Cusack was sort bland but that was the nature his character.) The acting here very flat sometimes wondered the bland acting Crouse was supposed some sort attack psychoanalysis). least the beginning. never gets really good, but evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes. Early the film, some Lindsay Crouse's lines the way she reads them sound they're inner monologue narration, which they aren't. With the arrival Mantegna things pick up.  The dialogue here isn't fun should be. was expecting crackerjack ring-a-ding-ding lines that roll off the tongue, but these ones don't. all sounds very read, rather than spoken. Maybe Mamet evolved after this film and loosened up, but not, then maybe should let others direct his words. He's far too precious with them here and result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality. What's more strange that other than this, the film doesn't look feel like play. The camera very cinematic. only problem with \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" was that looked too much like filmed theatre, but that film the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free. Everything flowed.  I wouldn't mind much sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines even play characters speaking play lines but here sounds like movie (or even book) characters speaking play lines. It's weird jumble theatre and film that just doesn't work. That doesn't mean the movie bad isn't, it's often extremely entertaining. The best chunk the middle.  It's standard con movie stuff: the new guy (in this case, girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved the seedy con underworld. How she gets involved is: she's psychiatrist and one her patients, Billy compulsive gambler. She wants help him out with his gambling debt, she walks into The House Games, dingy game room where con men work back room. I'll admit the setup pretty improbable. (Were they just expecting Crouse come in? Were they expecting she'd write cheque? Was Billy it? One these questions definitely answered the end, however.)  And from here the cons are start roll out. found the beginning ones the little learner ones the most fun. We're getting lesson the art the con much Crouse is.   We see the ending coming, and then didn't see the second ending coming, and then the real ending didn't see coming but maybe you did. The ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and the last scene the movie realize that the second Crouse walked into The House Games she found her true calling.  I'm going forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange line-reading because there are many good things here. the first part the movie seems stagy, stick with it. After the half-hour mark does really get momentum going. you want fun con movie, then here she is. you want Mamet, watch \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" again James Foley did him better.  ***,\n One John's Funniest, Eugene Levy great this one well, Just wish the studio would figure out that this one needs DVD, have video tape, but feel that this film deserves DVD (and extras would great) the Kung Uuniversity (Kung skit very funny, the entire film, also the scenes has with his girlfriend and her family are great, this movie never seems TV, but loses most it's hilarity when edited for broadcast TV, you can find the video would suggest you buy (ebay good place find copy) will keep VHS until one day get see DVD. there are many great movies out there that still have not been released DVD, and this one them.,\n The Underground Comedy movie perhaps one the worst comedies I've ever seen. should have known was going bad when the box had the phrase \"guaranteed offend\" written it... meaning that the filmmakers were going focus more grossing you out than making you laugh.  This movie amateurish jumble childish skits, bad characters, and worse jokes... from the pathetic Bat-Man sketch the painfully unfunny Arnold Shvollenpecker skit, they just aren't funny. The few skits that are little funny are few and far between watching Micheal Clark Duncan play gay virgin, for example but even they too long and get ruined from Vince Offer's ineptness comedy.  Keep The Underground Comedy Movie underground... bury it!,\n I'm studying Catalan, and was delighted find Mar, movie with mostly Catalan dialogue, art-house video store.  Hmmm... not delighted have seen it.  Yes, other reviewers have said, it's well-made, and beautifully photographed. Although the opening sequence the children shockingly violent, it's well-acted and convincing. (For the most part, that is... Would the Mallorquins strip corpse preparation for burial right the middle the town square, full view the dead man's 10-year-old boy?) Oh, well... minor detail. this point, had something the feel non-magical Pan's Labyrinth, also set the Spanish Civil War.  Fast-forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident have come age. Francisca nun working tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, both are patients. know, but hey, coincidences happen.  The problem, with many Spanish movies (apologies Almodovar fans), that with one exception (Francisca) the characters are just dang *weird*. Their motivations, personalities, and dialogue are often simply incoherent.  What's more, descends into some horrific wretched excess. prepared for LOTS pain and LOTS blood. The reviewer who called \"potboiler\" quite track. had been made years ago, the poster would've said: SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE!! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! ANIMAL CRUELTY!! BETRAYAL!!   The opening sequence not nearly enough make the personalities and relationships the characters believable. work, this should have had multiple flashbacks flesh out the characters. is, seems bizarre and depressing cross between \"Brother Sun, Sister Moon\" and \"Pulp Fiction.\" that sounds like something you've got see, all means, enjoy. think with something that doesn't make feel need take shower wash off the gore and gloom.  As for the Catalan, it's the Mallorqui dialect, fairly different than the Barcelona dialect, though was surprised the comment that said that even Barcelonans apparently needed Catalan subtitles understand it.,\n And that's why historic/biographic movies are important all us, moreover when they are well done, like this one!  Before saw \"The Young Victoria\", knew few things about Queen Victoria, but the end got much more knowledge about it.   Emily Blunt simply GREAT Victoria (Who would guess that!) and She probably will get nomination this years Oscar's. Personally, I'm cheering for her...  For technical issues, pleased say that very successful production, with wonderful Art Direction/Set Decoration and, course, like was expected be, terrific periodic Costume Design!   The one drawback that want see more and know more about this interesting queen, but foremost, incredible woman and mother!   BRAVO: out 10!,\n The movie uses cutting edge title for lame story. Kill Kill, would have been nice. The movie incorporates taboo scenes make the viewer move back their chairs. The scenes are unnecessary and choppy. The movie something novice screen writer could have conjured. Just waste movie props and network money. have write lines text critique this film when not worth lines time, but have push let the people know avoid the nonsense. people are counting you choose good movie for movie night, pick something else. you have soul don't damage subjecting yourself this filth.,\n Not only this great African-American classic comedy, but one many great American cult classics.I have recently purchased the collection edition Rudy Ray Moore.If you love the old school karate movies and black comedies, this for you! They don't make movies like these anymore. entire family are movie buffs, this site extreme help solving many debates. deployed Iraq right now. This helps stay connected world that know the states. Thank you IMDb.I recommend this site all friends. Dolemite rules! Don't just take word for it, check them out for yourself. Ten lines lot for commenting one movie think, but gets the point across, I'm all for it!,\n \"Darius Goes West\" the touching story brave teen coping with Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy and his personal quest see the Pacific Ocean. receives help and encouragement from group young men who love and care for him while going this quest.  The story has natural drama and honest portrayal the commitment young people help one their own stricken with this incurable disease.  Anyone who thinks young people are self-centered and narcissistic will find this movie turn that stereotype its head. the power the young people and their engagement with Darius' plight that very compelling this documentary.,\n Take: funny take THE LION KING, posing sequel. Surprisingly amusing.   Surprisingly, \"Lion King 1/2\" actually another funny straight-to-video, that's worth theatrical treatment. don't see why Disney released this straight video, and release crappy movies like \"Chicken Little\" and \"Return Neverland\" theatrically. Those movies are better off seen the video stores (in the \"new releases\" area), rather than seeing their theatrical posters outside the theaters.  This one merely spoof the first film (although the events \"Simba's Pride\" hasn't taken place yet), Timon (voiced Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa's (voiced Ernie Sabella) point view. get see them make fun the events the first film. Original voices from the first film, like Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, return their voicing roles from the first film, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give some hilarious comedy relief Timon's mom and grumpy uncle.  So doesn't this sound fun. Maybe not now, but watch for yourself. The fact that it's not that serious its plot makes the more enjoyable. It's kinda like MST3000 with Timon and Pumbaa.  Video movie rating: ***1/2 out,\n the title write that the story ludicrous. below I'll elaborate and tell you why it, humble opinion, ruins this movie.  Gere and Danes are doing their jobs, and while it's not their best work, it's quite OK. The rest the cast, though, doing really poor job. Mind you, this not entirely the actors fault. The problem that Gere and Danes are the only ones that have characters that have even the slightest room the movie really give any depth. All other characters have either too little room the movie create any depth, the character such cliché that doesn't matter how hard the actors try.  The director has bit Se7en complex, but looking merely the direction, think does job.  But the story. This the kind script that bad two ways. First all it's bad movie script. The characters are shallow (except for Gere's and Danes' characters), the villains are clichés and the actions the characters totally unbelievable. Besides this, the writers must have agenda where they want bring back our views and ethics hundred years. It's the kind movie that are saying that some criminals are still criminals, regardless the fact that they have paid the price the society has given them. It's also the kind movie that says, albeit only between the lines, that every form sexual deviance should punished without trial, judge jury. And course, according the movie, everything that not sex the missionary position married couple sexual deviance.  So, you're going film school and need example bad script, you're writing scripts yourself and want ego boost. See it. For everyone else, recommend another movie.,\n Well, had sit down the computer and write down the review immediately after watching this puddle ooze. Why? Because have let known all you just how bad this movie is. It's unbelievably bad. Just let you how bad is, I'll offer this little detail about the movie. During scenes mayhem, which usually consists people shooting kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard right. This movie really sucks. fact, makes think about the fact that costs ten dollars these days just get into the theaters these days. And see corn filled crap like this? There story speak and the movie basically has nothing offer other than the occasional boob shot and really cheap kills. I'm really disappointed with this, knowing that watched it. OK, I'm dumbstruck. It's bad can't even find the words. RATING: ZERO out *****.,\n will sum this movie... bunch skanky British women have some disease that basically turning them into zombies. The whole movie consists these women talking, smoking, and rarely going out for \"meat\" humans eat. swear had MAKE myself watch this movie... UGH,\n Priyadarshan's HERA PHERI was nice situational comedy This film however actually lacks story but quite funny but illogical  In fact they proper story yet somehow manages nice flow though isn't anything great  The first half has funny scenes like the one where Akshay and John invite Neha for lunch and another when Paresh enters  The first half gets boring slowly but the second half funnier though they script   The jokes are funny though one does wonder how they never hear each person's voices from inside the rooms?  The climax confusion treated like stage play but it's quite funny But the film ends abruptly  Direction okay Music good  Akshay Kumar excels his part which now become his second skin, but this his film completely and overshadows everyone else  John stumbles throughout and fails comedy Paresh Rawal hilarious Rajpal okay The girls are loud times and awkward too Nargis, Daisy and Neetu(only Neetu seen now) are good parts but shriek too often Manoj Joshi okay,\n have agree with some the other comments and even step further.   Nothing about this film worked, absolutely nothing. Delmar our central character makes the decision become surrogate mother order earn enough money buy restaurant but along the way fall for wise ex-jailbird. the same time her friend Hortense trying get her lawyer boyfriend finally marry her. She also happens sleeping with Marlon who desperately love with her. Then there's Delmar's brother Jethro who gets involved with former coke addict, Missy who reveals she was sexually abused her adopted father. the sidelines also have the eccentricmother who has assortment equally odd friends, one whom dies the couch the beginning the film. far good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life, death, grief and love the first half, the film simply loses direction.   If the writer had only selected one two characters and allowed follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time given all with the result that one story character fully developed. For instance, why does Delmar think she will able hand over her child exchange for money, especially when the prospective parents are creepy bigoted lawyer and his semi alcoholic and depressed wife? Why Hortense desperate marry man who jerk and clearly doesn't love her? How Missy manages kick her coke habit overnight? Jethro regularly drawn women with overwhelming problems, Missy the exception? Has Delmar and Jethro's mother always been the eccentric side, more recent development? Why Jethro keen Cadillacs that has one the middle his living room? Why did Moses spend years prison for stealing car, relatively minor crime? How does Delmar manage end giving birth Moses' baby when there suggestion that they ever had sex?   These questions are posed the screenplay but sadly are never answered. can only assume they were answered the original novel and that why the writer felt the need include all the script. Big mistake. Losing several subplots especially the Hortense and Marlon story, which adds nothing the overall film, would have tightened things considerably and allowed more time develop the Delmar, Jethro and Moses characters who are clearly more central the plot and underlying themes than anyone else.   Add that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside the average soap opera and the result huge missed opportunity for all, including Jorja Fox who does her best rise above the material. I'm not surprised that this appears have been the director's last film this effort shows evidence visual style ability tell moving and intelligent story.,\n wasn't expecting impacted this film portraying family just like the one you'd expect living next door. They are ordinary flesh-and-blood people, not like the typical Hollywood fare. They face all too common problem--debilitating illness. But the story-line grips the heart with powerful lesson. Casting, script, direction, and acting flow together with surge that draws the viewer deep into the story. Give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire.,\n this the \"worse\" Star Trek TOS episode? Maybe, least gets vote being the bottom mean, this episode makes absolutely freaking sense. Seeing something that makes you mad? Give break. This episode also has different feel it, the music heightened, almost forced enhance feeling distress, the point that sucks. Give some Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, higher beings like Triskelion's anything but Medusin's, these are very boring aliens make episode around. McCoy gets utter his famous phrase \"He's Dead, Jim\". Spock puts the protective goggles when transporting the ambassador away but Kirk does not. They through that freaking \"barrier\" now for the third time that can remember, boring. least season three's next episodes would \"Spectre The Gun\", and \"Day The Dove\" and others follow, making Trek decent show watch syndication where would pick people like avid fans. Personal observations, Trek loved use the color purple, its kind pinkish purple, like when they are the corridor outside the compartment, the gangway that normally grey now purple. never had purple bridge but its interesting see, noticed several episodes, was done light filter and works very well but this episode, the ships corridor pretty lame.,\n thoroughly enjoyed this true form take the Dick Tracy persona. This well done product that used modern technology craft imagery filled comic era story. you are fan recently watched some the old Dick Tracy b&w movies then you're sure get kick out this rendition. The pastel colors and larger than life characters rendered painstakingly authentic take era gone entertainment it's meant be. personally find Madonna's musical element major part this film-the featuring her music from this movie one I've listened often over the years, it's just well done and performed musically and tuned that era. mind, Madonna's finest moment both on-screen but especially musically. This sure bring out the \"kid\" you.,\n had higher hopes for this Carnosaur movie simply because seemed like the sequels were getting better they came out. did like Carnosaur better than figured well this one newer must better right? Well... quickly learned was wrong. was extremely confused with the casting. They brought back Rick Dean for another spotlight character and Michael MacDonald police officer. Now for Rick dean lol, Carnosaur thought fit the role pretty well and wasn't really annoyed him, now Carnosaur wow they placed him elite soldier. Now are getting goofy here. The movie actually started out pretty good with decent gun fight and dinos escaping out there little freezer trucks, but soon Scott Valentines team showed had mix romantic comedy with very funny performances from retarded and floppy dinosaurs.  I'll start with the raptors first, they had there tails drag the ground, which the second one they were the air which looked more common for dinosaur that can run 50-60 mph. Now when they ran they wiggled back and forth and the heads didn't move all. there hands were floppy all over the place and since they were extremely poorly shot the director they looked stupid and out place.  The t-rex was extremely pathetic, they would been better off using the one from the previous movies. least that one looked somewhat frightening. The one this film looked like was smiling all the time. The legs when walked was hilarious, like was john wayne the old west all stiff legged and stuff. LOL another thing noticed that the hands did not move, they were stuck next its body looked and sounded (god the sound effects were awful) retarded!!! Now was the director and realized that had this work with maybe would maybe tried little bit harder hide the fakeness fact. for the rest the movie, well this was the sloppiest and loudest military team have ever seen. The weapons they used wouldn't make sense for the scenario. They even had arm wrestling scene inside the warehouse where the carnosaurs were roaming, now was tickled this scene because thought that while this stupidity was going that the Dinos would get there and cause some damage. Instead the director wasted about minutes our time. would like look this movie the stooges dinosaur movies. You have retarded military, retarded dinosaurs, retarded scenario and you have wonderful minutes spend your day watching this.  Now I'm not saying wouldn't watch this, actually recommend everyone see this movie that wants minutes pure entertainment. may seem like I'm ranting but really I'm hyping this movie what is. Its really lot fun watch because while watching this you think yourself, \"did the director really make this seriously?\",\n When Paris Burning came out, totally dismissed it. was not into the whole Madonna and vogueing phenomenon. thought was going campy and silly. How wrong was about this movie. watched after the movie had been out for ten years and ran out and bought it. took back time and place fun and excitement. felt though knew all the characters personally. The 80s were spectacular and the movie captured the essence the gay culture. What terrific job! went the internet and found out what some the original casts members were doing now but have not been able locate all them. any one has any information any the casts members please let know.   I hope they make another documentary. LOVED,\n have lost count how many reviews I've written Slaughter High. I've read lot bad ones and will say right now this fantastic movie. Simon Scuddamore made his fame short time for his well known suicide, and even though this was his only film, what made the movie great. first did not know anything about Simon until read review about his suicide. Then found out due the current webpage www.IMDb.com was born 1957, Dayton, Ohio. Simon may have played the most pathetic character known man, but his real life self certainly had their strenghths and weaknesses. did good acting job, who can disagree? always wondered how felt showing himself naked movie. Must have been pretty embarrassing say the least. first saw this movie when was the sixth grade. agree with some pointers like the girl would not take bath after somebody was murdered, and that high schools NOT have bath tubs! think Caroline Munro who was the time was the only other star that had any dignified acting talent, and unfortunately for Simon's death made future films. The reason(s) for his suicide are mystery, and hopefully will discovered the near future. Doing the math his webpage tells you was years old when made Slaughter High. looked like teenager. give this film two thumbs up, the best horror film made. Probably because their horrible acting the others didn't make fame the movie business. -Jacob Young,\n There are movies that are awful, and there are movies that are awful they are deemed long-forgotten and unwatchable. Also, lots violence and bad stuff (not just cheesy stuff; you know what mean) add the mix well. What the result bad movies with such raunchy content? Why, \"Final Justice,\" course!   Remember \"Mitchell?\" Joe Don Baker was the star that movie, and that was riffed Joel and the Bots \"Mystery Science Theater 3000.\" Now this time, with Mike taking Joel's place the Satellite Love (but with the same bots), that trio got make fun MST3K's second Joe Don Baker movie, \"Final Justice.\" course, much the naughty stuff that mentioned was removed for television release, but still, want watch that episode (and \"Mitchell\" well), because what does Joe Don \"hate\" the most? Why, none other than \"Mystery Science Theater 3000!\"   P.S. you have Big Lots nearby, check that store for the uncut tape! LOL That happened another user!,\n makes sense that this film getting raves from Hollywood because oftentimes Hollywood it's all just popularity contest. also makes sense when you think that people who are liking the film may just reacting the countless songs being spit out you rather than story content. Yet, this film overrated and overblown. Eddie Murphy looks just ridiculous. way Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles give the Oscar rated performance many have raved over BEFORE the film was even out. can't even believe that Condon being set nominated for Directing Oscar when all did was put together album. Glitz does not replace nothing storyline. bunch songs does not movie make.,\n This lovely, spirit-restoring movie. From the use the actual villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim write the novel the 1920s the inspired casting, every choice was perfectly right! The quiet joy this film doesn't stale after repeated viewings. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem have been born play these parts! would dearly love see Enchanted April released DVD widescreen format.,\n was really horrified this eerie movie. What unusual dark atmosphere. And such creepy musical score. Really promising! Indeed, after ten minutes you really start sweating, and feeling uncomfortable, for you start fearing the worst. This movie has the atmosphere true nightmare, and what's worse-it all comes out. For one hour and half have been trying fight complete boredom and falling asleep, but the monstrous soundtrack kept awake. Nuit Noire truly horrifying picture for your eyes, your ears, your intelligence, and most all: your wallet, since the thought spending precious money movie ticket for this cheap amateuristic homevideo the biggest horror all.,\n This one powerful film. The first time saw it, the Scottish accents made tough for understand lot and that ruined the viewing experience. gave but then acquired the DVD, used the English subtitles when needed them, and really got into this movie, discovering just how good is. excellent.  The widescreen picture makes spectacular parts, with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded Braveheart, involving tale good versus evil. Here, it's Liam Neeson (good) vs. Tim Roth (evil). Both their jobs well.  Few actors come across despicable Roth. Man, you really want smack this guy his arrogant, irritating puss. (He nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone else's here). Neeson man's man and solid hero figure Gibson was Braveheart. Jessica Lange strong here the female lead. The movie draws you and gets you totally involved, prepared have emotional experience viewing this.,\n what arguably the best outdoor adventure film all time, four city guys confront nature's wrath, story survival. The setting backwoods Georgia, with its forests, mountains, and wild rivers.  The director, John Boorman, chose use local people, not actors, portray secondary characters. These locals imbue the film with depth characterization unequaled film history. central casting \"actors\" could ever come close these people's remarkable faces, voices, actions. don't recall film wherein the secondary characters are realistic and colorful. much anything else, this gritty realism that makes this film amazing.  Another strength the film's theme. Nature, the wild, can violent. How appropriate that the setting should the American South. Very few places the U.S. are, have been, violent redneck country. story about Darwinian survival the fittest, the film conveys the idea that humans are part nature, not separate from it.  \"Deliverance\" very much product its time when, unlike today, Americans expressed concern over vanishing wilderness. The film's magnificent scenery, the sounds birds, frogs, crickets, and the roar the river rapids, combined with the absence civilization, all convey environmental message. And that another strength the film.  At entertainment level, the tension gradually escalates, the plot proceeds. Not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme, and then never lets up, not until the final credits roll. Very few films can sustain that level intensity over such long span plot.  Finally, the film's technical quality topnotch. Direction and editing are flawless. Cinematography excellent. Dialogue interesting. And the acting terrific. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Ned Beatty perfectly cast and does fine job. And Jon Voight should have been nominated for Oscar. there weak link the film, the music, which strikes timid.  Overall, \"Deliverance\" almost certainly will appeal viewers who like outdoor adventure. Even for those who don't, the gritty characterizations, the acting, and the plot tension are reasons enough watch this film, one the finest cinema history.,\n family looking for some old roadside attractions include the father's coffee-table book come across ancient, decrepit old freak show run eccentric one-eyed man. When their family van breaks down upon leaving the sideshow, they're forced stay nearly abandoned fishing camp that was the site prison break decades prior.  There have been many films the 'freak' subgenre horror, ranging from Tod Browning's beloved 'Freaks' (1932) Alex Winter's hilarious 'Freaked' (1993). Those are both classics (or soon-to-be with 'Freaked'). 'Side Sho,' however, never will be. And ever does reach classic status. well, will obvious clue the sad state our genre. From the ridiculously bad opening song the 17-year-old daughter that's obviously older than her natural mother, this film did not have much going for it. The writing was subpar, but not completely awful. just boring. The direction was poor, and the rare freak effects were pretty horrendous and unbelievable. The acting was abysmal and the casting was even worse. Anyone who would believe the ages these two camp-age teenagers must not have met teenager long, long time. There was far from enough gore violence make for the lack any other quality. and when there was bit violence, was not well done all. And, can't forget mention the ending fight scenes which were, with all honesty, some the worst I've ever, ever seen film. Overall, this easily forgettable and poorly made horror film that deserves left alone the bottom the dollar bin.  Final verdict: 2.5/10.,\n minutes into this movie was hyperventilating, shaking, and writhing pain. And not the good way. The story about troupe idiotic children making prank phone calls psycho which always good idea. Turns out psychos don't like prank phone calls because minutes time he's their door killing poor Williams mom and dad. Well skip ahead years and guess what? Still prank phone calling people. Yep you would thought that horrible murder would deterred them from doing that ever again but no. after about two hours later and way too many scream ripoffs realized that this movie gave nothing but terrible taste mouth and severe urge take own life. This piece crap isn't even worth laughing the shoddy production, the \"acting\", Rutger haurs dwindling career. love crappy horror movies but this the most unsatisfying piece I've ever seen. Just don't.,\n spotted this movie the video store few years ago and rented it. husband and enjoyed much bought the VHS and have enjoyed ever since.  The plot has been well-discussed, need going over again. The point this movie deserves repeated viewings. Americans, especially, aren't going get all the jokes the first time around. know didn't.  This movie funny, touching, sad-- all the same time. When Ray proposes the toast his daughter's wedding, it's cringe-inducing. When Karen calls Tony \"Brian\" attempts kiss her, it's heartbreaking. When Beano finally cornered the woman black, it's too funny for words.  And the music: it's good any movie soundtrack I've heard years. was dancing the living room \"All Over the World.\"   Every performance absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal Ray, man who has had one too many bad trips. Stephen Rea perfect Tony, the lovable keyboard player who has carried torch for Karen all these years. has appealing hangdog look that makes women want hug him. But all the actors are equally brilliant.  Ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it. It's gem.,\n love cheesy horror flicks. don't care the acting sub-par whether the monsters look corny. liked this movie except for the bewildered feeling all the way from the beginning the film the very end. Look, don't need page dissertation sign with big letters explaining plot me. But Dark Floors takes the \"what this movie about?\" thing whole new (annoying) level. What this movie about?  This isn't exceptionally scary thrilling but you have hour and half kill and/or you want end feeling frustrated and confused, rent this winner.,\n This movie embarrassment film-making. can't believe was even listed comedy not funny. Not only was the script atrocious, but the casting people should shot. Gail O'Grady just great actress, but beyond that... %99 the rest the cast...ouch. Pretty much everyone else...wow hard even...wow. Here the number one rule about comedy \"DON'T TRY FUNNY\". There are lot very talented actors Canada who can drama and comedy none them were used this film. Canadian nepotism and casting directors are helping perpetuate bad film-making Canada. realize this technically \"US\" film, but look the director, actors, location, etc. just saw this Bravo they should ashamed that they bought the rights show this film. Again, there are lot great films out there that can't get airtime and they show this crap.,\n Two old men sitting park bench don`t really have problem with this scene Only problem that it`s not scene it`s the entire movie  Yup movies don`t get anymore low concept than this They also don`t get anymore boring than this either but there`s worse come because these two old men are chalk and cheese One Nat Moyer who Yiddish communist while the other Midge Carter former golden gloves champion who`s also black Let see now Jew and black man sitting park bench getting along fine Well guess it`s possible though unlikely but this film has such inoffensive scenario why play the Jewish stereotype Why make them loud tribilistic rabble rousers who take hebrew oaths Slightly ironic that the Jews seen the start the movie are exactly the type Jews seen Nazi propaganda films the 1930s  Stereotypes aside moi dearz the problem with I`M NOT RAPPAPORT that it`s written for entirely different meduim than cinema it`s based stage play and shows Walter Matthau sleepwalks through his role Nat while this commentator almost slept through the whole movie,\n \"My Left Foot\" pretty impressive film that tells the story Christy Brown, artist who was crippled with cerebral palsy and learned paint with his left foot, the only limb his body had control over. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar Best Actor for this film, which I'm not absolutely certain was deserved, but still noteworthy. Day-Lewis give Brown realistic and occasionally almost humorous touch. Brenda Fricker, Brown's devoted mother, also won Oscar for believable and touching role. problem with this film that bit too real times. When Brown desperation and must help someone and all with his left foot, the film can difficult watch. This gives often depressing feel that may turn off some viewers for time. However, you look beyond that, you will see sense hope and inspiration for those who have handicaps and other difficulties overcome. Those who are not crippled and still consider ourselves have problems are inspired this film, because somewhat with much worse condition than can overcome their difficulties, can certainly the same thing. Well made, occasionally enjoyable, but difficult watch. May not for everyone, but not bad all.  *** out ****,\n This movie one the most awful I've ever seen. Not only the dialogue awful, never ends. You'll think it's ending, but it's not. How long it, 140, 160 minutes? don't even know. know that I'll never watch again. It's like someone took romantic comedy, took out the comedy, then decided downplay the romance, leaving with the pile crap that managed make its way the screen. But don't take word for it, find out for yourself how terrible this film is.,\n argued with myself whether rent this not. I'm always afraid renting something I've never heard (don't remember this being theaters). Great cast...that's what tipped the scales. minutes in, almost stopped watching it. The first few minutes are fun watch, but unbelievable. only gets worse after that. The writers this movie could little research future projects they want make their movies even little better. they could just try writing something just little bit believable. give 3....a for the writing (only because there are words)and for being able get many good actors agree this movie despite having read the script. god this movie sucks.,\n Worst Bob Hope comedy ever(and that includes some heavy competition). Hope, island with sailors, dreams aloud being bathtub with geisha girl \"steering his ship\". Somebody certainly steered this Hope-hackery over the cliff, features Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida and still can't work any laughs excitement. Where's Bing Crosby when you really need him?,\n have seen lot bad movies with big actors it. But this movie was terrible. have yet see why people thought was funny. The idea behind stupid. Plus all the things that are supposed funny are just dumb. Why anyone would want watch this more than once just baffles me!,\n Loosely based the James Corbett biography \"The Roar The Crowd\", Gentleman Jim wonderfully breezy picture that perfectly encapsulates not only the rise the pugilistic prancer that was Corbett, but also the wind change regards the sport boxing circa the 1890s.  The story follows Corbett perfectly casted Errol Flynn} from his humble beginnings bank teller San Fransico, thru chance fight with boxing champion that eventually leads him fighting the fearsome heavyweight champion the world, John Sullivan {beefcake personified delightfully Ward Bond}. Not all the fights are the ring tho, and it's all the spin off vignettes Corbett's life that makes this grand entertaining picture. There are class issues overcome here {perfectly played out fellow club members pay have him knocked down peg two}, and Corbett has not only fight get respect from his called peers, but must also overcome his ego grows briskly his reputation does. Along with the quite wonderful Corbett family, and all their stoic humorous support, Corbett's journey enthralling joyous, yet brash and bold is, very likable character, and it's character that befits the tagged moniker got Gentleman Jim.  The film never sags for one moment, and it's testament director Raoul Walsh that although are eagerly awaiting the final fight, the outer ring goings are keeping firmly entertained, not even the love interest sub plot hurts this picture {thank you Alexis Smith}. The fight sequences stand really well, and they perfectly show just how Corbett became the champ was, his brand dancing rings round slugger fighters now firmly placed boxing history. the final reel rolls all come down earth after fight meeting between Sullivan and Corbett puts all the brutality into context, and it's here where humility and humbleness becomes the outright winner, and far this viewer goes..............it will for sure sure, 9/10 for truly wonderful picture.,\n Making the film dark and visually fuzzy possible order cover the budget deficiencies often-used strategy low-budget horror films, but this one takes too far. poorly lit and murky (and takes place almost entirely night, boot) that you often end virtually looking black screen (although perhaps the bad video transfer may also have had something with that). Alas, \"murky\" also the best word describe the movie's plot. The filmmakers throw diverse (and unoriginal) horror ideas without any semblance logic, and halfway through you get the feeling that they just about abandoned the effort make good horror film; you know when you see characters who are supposed mortal danger (or, some occasions, even dead) making small talk....(*1/2),\n family goes back New Orleans late 1600's early 1700's and watching the movie knew was history grand-parents never talked about, but knew existed. have cousins obviously black aka African Americans and others who can \"pass\" white and chose not to. It's hard history watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that Cane River all part that history. makes want cry and makes want kick the 'arse' great grandfathers who owned those plantations and wonder awe how great grandmothers African heritage lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence...And the same time had not come out that history, probably wouldn't the successful business woman today living successfully fairly integrated world. The acting was both excellent and fair depending upon the actor, but movie that NEEDED made. Anne Rice incredible and ask myself, why she 'symbolically' writing about family and I'm not. recommend this movie everyone. Leza,\n Brilliant execution displaying once and for all, this time the venue politics, how \"good intentions actually pave the road hell\". Excellent!,\n \"Houseboat Horror\" often regarded the worst Australian film ever made and described typical slasher film,which carried the promotion 'See the movie that can't get Academy Award'.An underground disco band members begins die slashed death burned maniac they are attempting shoot music video remote lake the Australian outback.Badly acted and written slasher flick with zero suspense and annoying characters.It certainly delivers the gore:heads are split half with machete,throats are cut and woman killed with horseshoe.If you like cheesy slasher movies you can give this one try,but you have been warned.At least it's better than Swedish \"The Bleeder\".4 out 10.,\n tragically wonderful movie... brings Japan that does not exist anymore. Despite Hollywood's technical expertise, have yet see (hollywood) movie that can match the authenticity the atmosphere this small town the river near the sea... Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai looked liked the last installment the Lord The Rings trying capture rural Old Japan.  If you like serene but intense story lines, this must see film. will respite from hollow flashy films much like the last 1000 blockbusters you saw. think this one Kurosawa's better stories.  Even it's movie about geishas and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life such settings, did not turn into skin flick. The characters are full depth and act with much intensity.,\n First all, you'r fan the comic, well, you'll VERY disappointed I'm sure Low budget movie !!! Largo supposed Serbian the comic, now suddenly becomes croatian, pfff! chicken producers, gave some spice and guts the comic the way, the film, his father speaks Serbian and speaks croatian... Lol The striking N.Y. Winch building becomes common average-small yacht H.K. The good looking Largo becomes some unshaved Tzigan/Turkish looking guy. Freddy the cool 'scarface' pilot becomes some fat, out shape, sad, average guy. Simon, Largo's good buddy, does not exist all gave some pepper Largo doesn't throw knifes all, but just some snake stares... The whole story confused and looks like pretentious TV-film. French directors and producers, you don't have the money, the ability the technology adapt correctly the comic, please stick some romance shooted Paris. Very very bad film, good thing just rented it, don't count watch the sequel there any,\n the beginning the film watch May and Toots preparing for their trip London for visit their grown children. One can see Toots not the best health, but goes along. When dies suddenly, May's world, begins spin out control.  The film directed Roger Michell, based screen play Hanif Kureshi, study how this mother figure comes terms with her new status life and her awakening into world that she doesn't even know existed until now.  May's life suburban wife was probably boring. Obviously her sexual life was next nothing. get know she's had short extra marital affair, then nothing all. When May loses her husband she can't back home, instead, she stays behind minding her grandson her daughter's home. this setting that May begins lusting after young and hunky Darren, her daughter's occasional lover.  Darren awakes May passion she has not ever known. May responds transforming herself front our eyes. May, who the beginning the film dowdy, suddenly starts dressing up, becoming interesting and attractive woman. She ends falling heads over heels with this young man that keeps her sated with passion she never felt before.  Having known couple cases similar this story, came surprise watch May's reaction. Her own chance normal relationship with Bruce, widower, ends frustratingly for May, who realizes how great her sex with Darren. The younger man, figure, only into this affair satisfy himself and for possibility extorting money from May. Finally, the daughter, Helen discovers what Mum has been doing behind her back when she discovers the erotic paintings her mother has made.  The film triumph for the director. Anne Reid, Mr. Michell has found extraordinary actress who brings much the role May. Also amazing Daniel Craig. knows how Darren will react the situation. Anna Wilson Jones Helen also vital the story she the one that has confront the mother about what has been going behind her back. Oliver Ford Davies plays small part Bruce the older man Helen's class and quite effective.  The film rewarding for those that will see with open mind. <br,\n Oh, dear lord.... They've turned what was fairly thought provoking movie into swaggering testosterone fest.  The original 1971 version this movie was beautifully vague about our hero Kowalski. was man trying drive from Denver San Fransisco win bet. Why was willing risk his life for the price handful uppers? We're not really sure.  We had few flashbacks that gave the picture that was adrenaline junkie, and presumably had led his entire life trying make the vanishing point. That point you see off the distance where the left and right shoulders the road come together, and the road itself vanishes. lives only free, and means ill anyone. saw several times when there were accidents stopped make sure the other driver was okay before moving on, even the cops that were chasing him.  When saw the futility his quest took his life rather than arrested and live life captivity. died like lived, running wide open.  In the remake Kowalski has whole history (including first name, even.) He's trying get the hospital where his wife suffering from complications her pregnancy. devoted husband, and excited expectant father. comes the decision take his life after hearing his wife died delivery, but they even leave THAT question when they suggest that may have jumped out the car before ran into the bulldozers. They even gave the part \"super soul,\" the blind (brilliantly portrayed Clevon Little the original) JASON PRIESTLY?!?!?!?!?!? Give break.,\n this movie just excuse for the writer make film out failed scripts.  its characters are just assembly characters with cliché tragic comic attributes the sum total which neurotic dialog like only woody Allen could write. woman love this because its like looking the mirror they will enjoy this film probably  this movies was not enjoyed however because there was car chase and also the film didn't have any fights. there was also drug lords gang bangers. Not mention lack snakes. This film had snakes. Not cup tea and maybe not yours ether think about what have said before you find yourself watching this film.  Unless course you resemble female have weight issues man issues enjoy sex and the city and ally mcbeal then this meaningful for you.,\n good idea, badly implemented. While that could summarize 99% the SciFi channel's movies, really applies here. love movies where good back story slowly revealed, and like action movies, and like all the main actors, this could have been great. However, despite some good acting, this movie fails due Bill Platt's bad writing and directing.  Another review made the good point needing know where you're going you can get there. This movie doesn't. It's put together such haphazard way that you know the words \"second draft\" are not Bill Platt's vocabulary. There one scene that entirely unnecessary and could removed without anyone noticing. This scene even begins and ends with them driving car, you could cut from one car scene the other and never have missed the pointless scene the middle.  This movie also had strange habit under explaining some details while over explaining others, some the point where you can guess the entire \"plot\" front. also had habit aborting fight early, probably just because they couldn't afford it. There are also few laughably bad scenes where the \"plot\" revealed computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed \"toxic adhesive\" (seriously, what *is* that?).  If you are fan Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because she's OK. She does manage break out her \"Roswell\" persona few times and make for good tough chick (but not always). John Lancie plays the same character plays everything he's ever done since playing back ST:TNG, that's nothing new.  In all, gave this movie 4/10 rating.,\n Reading review THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED, many may assume that I'm some year old who thinks SCREAM considered \"classic\" horror. This not the case, I'm years old and have been watching horror films for most life. But admittedly, I'm child the 80's that grew slasher/zombie/ghost/cannibal, etc...types horror films typically prefer horror films that are more graphic and faster-paced. Just like someone who can appreciate different music, painting, this case, film but not necessarily like them can appreciate why some people may enjoy this sort film...I just don't...  THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED exceedingly dull and tedious film about school for wayward girls. The heavy-handed mistress the school rules with iron hand (or whip some cases...) keep the girls line. She has young son who creeps around and peeps the girls while they shower (in their nightgowns less (?!?)...), and meanwhile, girls are disappearing from the school they are the victim murderer who's lurking about the campus...  I can see why THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED often compared SUSPIRIA (which masterpiece film opinion...), terms the atmosphere the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians but this film dull and uneventful that could barely stay awake. I'm all for \"tension\" and \"suspense\" horror films but this film held neither for me. Luckily, wasn't expecting whole lot going into this one, can't say was really disappointed THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED just reinforced the fact that personally don't typically enjoy most horror films much older than from the 70's. This isn't hard and fast rule, but those that HAVE enjoyed definitely seem more the exception. Probably \"must-see\" for horror fans who enjoy more understated and suggestive horror films but don't really know too many fans that sort material, can't really recommend this one...4/10,\n enjoyed it. general, I'm not fan comedies and comedians, but like Whoopi. I'm also partial Sci/Fi Fantasy. And the dinosaur craze. read for pleasure, but when I'm feeling over-stressed really mind-dead, watch movies escape. Theodore Rex enabled so. That makes success eyes! didn't even walk away something else while was running. Whether not was rated \"good\" not doesn't really matter me. And no, I'm not juvenile. Nor moron.,\n saw this film yesterday. must admit, weren't cup tea. Although it's supposed horror movie its kind. But was watching this, was thinking.. 'This movie isn't making any sense all..' Where earth did this guy the dark coat came from? Where were the two guys were going when they left the girls behind? Where earth did shark came out from?  All these elements this film somehow didn't add up. felt these filmmakers wasted much time and money film that was bound crap.  I've seen many good horror movies time, but this one the most worst horror flicks I've seen. the end the movie, said myself that wouldn't watch again.. much pappy show this film, I've decided give the thumbs down! Count out this one! out 10!,\n This extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music good, too, though mostly early the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are really superstars the cast, though several faces will familiar. The entire cast does excellent job with the script.  But hard watch, because there good end situation like the one presented. now fashionable blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There some merit this view, but it's also true that one forced Hindus and Muslims the region mistreat each other they did around the time partition. seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough exploit them their own ends.  The result that there much cruelty and inhumanity the situation and this very unpleasant remember and see the screen. But never painted black-and-white case. There baseness and nobility both sides, and also the hope for change the younger generation.  There redemption sort, the end, when Puro has make hard choice between man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But that point, she has option that without great pain for her.  This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can dignified and caring people. The reality partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. that sense, similar \"Mr Mrs Iyer\".  In the end, were glad have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. the and could deal with their own histories racism with this kind frankness, they would certainly better off.,\n This very funny movie! have idea whether translates well into other languages not. However, think men all over the world can identify with \"Frank\" and his thoughts some extent! These thoughts are hugely entertaining and women will also enjoy this movie I'm sure!  All cast members perform well, and this film could have been tremendous hit all over the world was made England the US. But for those you who are fortunate enough understand Swedish, you are for treat!  Highly recommended.,\n didn't know any better, almost seems like was staged, but wasn't. was set perfectly, and how they got all that footage amazing! The unfortunate events September 11, 2001 are put together well this documentary and the classic footage that they got made this unfortunate classic. Just the history the footage alone should make MUST see for any american person touched the tragedy September 11.,\n you are uninitiated the Gundam world, this good place start. you are burned out Star Wars Star Trek, here compelling, realistic sci-fi series you can become immersed in. Not the simplistic boy-saves-world-in-giant robot story you might have expected, but rather complex, emotionally compelling space war drama where the line between the \"good\" and \"bad\" guys decidedly less than distinct.  Gundam 0080 focuses the story Izuruha, young, naive boy living neutral space colony. spends his days daydreaming about Mobile Suits and playing war with his friends. During the course this series, befriends \"enemy\" soldier, Bernie Wiseman. the end, little learns some hard lessons about the reality war and the requisite suffering and sacrifice.  I loved this OAV series, with its cool mecha designs, involving story, and likeable characters. recommend this series anyone who likes realistic anime, those who think anime just silly sexy entertainment.,\n really loved this film, yes, know was fairly far fetched, there way that Shelby car could have managed stay the road well the 540i with all it's traction control and other gizmos but other than that the whole film was well put together. Cage was excellent usual and the rest the cast were also pretty good with the exception the Brit Bad Guy, was little \"too\" much don't you think? Anyway, great film, great cars and great acting. for one made sure car was locked and alarmed remotely controlled garage that night.,\n Terry Gilliam's fantastic, twisted story virus destroying all but handful people across the Earth and forcing them move underground and the man sent back time gather information about fantastic, dizzying, and highly stylized film that boasts Bruce Willis' best performance ever.  What sets Monkeys apart from most time-travel sci-fi movies that Bruce Willis character actually deals with what the psychological effects time-travel, that is, not knowing what reality actual reality: the place that the time-traveler comes from goes to. Also, the film recognizes that things that have past cannot altered and that the prevention cataclysmic event, this case the release said virus, cannot stopped changed. Willis asserts \"It's already happened,\" while he's mental hospital, the major dilemma the film trudges into not trite, overdone plot save the world; instead it's Willis' inner struggle simply survive himself. It's fresh, innovative concept, and works beautifully thanks tautly written script Peoples and Gilliam's unique brand dementia.  Besides this, Monkey's storytelling totally non-linear and instead opts distort and bend the way the story told skillfully incorporating bevy different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past, the future, and even scene that lifted out Hitchcock's Vertigo. All serve envelop the viewer into its disturbing cacophony madness and futility.  Visually, Gilliam master desolate umbrage and shadow rivalling Tim Burton his strikingly despondent scenery and imagery. With cold, wide, and immersing cinematography, Gilliam plunges into the colorless surroundings and darkness his characters. The scenes are often bathed strangely antiseptic, dead white and help serve contrast the often veering-on-madness characters.  Performance-wise, Brad Pitt steals most scenes, filling them with patented loony, off-the-wall performance that deservedly garnered him Oscar nomination. mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best performance his career, not reverting his heroic cliches and cardboard hero and instead portraying Cole simple, poignant, tragic everyman. Equally good Madeline Stowe Willis' psychologist. She holds her own, injecting her character with both wild energy and strength she collapses under the weight what she comes believe false 'religion.'  Gilliam's expert, overwhelming, and complex handling what could have been routine action/sci-fi film makes Monkeys compelling vision nightmarish, futuristic landscape. Its rich, well-thought out, intricate storyline along with bravura performances from the entire cast and its brooding, bleak cinematography make masterpiece madness. Ranking top all time, Monkeys darkly lavish spectacle film brimming with brilliance.  10 out,\n This movie being shown over and over cable lately, so..  There excuse for these attractive women fight over either Luke Wilson the equally vapid 'villian' this movie. The female actresses are very cute, and that's the only reason watch this movie. suppose 'funny' that Luke's even uglier/dorkier/stupider friend around, but well, that what get.  Neither the female leads would ever, EVER talk any the males this movie for more than minutes. What get them sobbing and crying and fighting and over guys that were best described Friday the 13th Dead *@$#,\n Loved the movie. Loved the two families crossing paths history. Only question Sam gets killed then how does his family's line continue? Madame Zeroni's son and Zero supposed related but mention any other children? Hmmmmmmmmm. Never mentioned any other children wife prior his speaking with and falling love with the teacher? Maybe she had child prior becoming the kissing Kate Bandit? Even with the mistakes the movie. Just loved it. The acting was great. Not sure where the story was with Mr. Sir being Marion women the end but makes his character even funnier. The other \"counseler\" did seem concerned for the kids but course maybe not much. Poor Warden must have had really stinky childhood mean when she grew up.,\n Saw this film ran the wee hours TCM. Several problems with the film were apparent from what saw. First, the adults did not age when the children did for years. Several parts the film had continuity problems for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the years passed.   The copy saw was missing about minutes so, least huge gap with black screen appeared. too bad, because even though the script left something desired, Bergman Russell both did fine the film their roles. shame the large chunk missing, but what here watchable.  I just wish was all intact. The script makes little sense that Bergman's character sent away when the kids are small but then brought back take care them when they are adults? Some the time lines don't make sense either. There stock market crash that resembles 1929 but the kids grow fight World War All the acting the support folks this film fine. Just wonder what was the gap film could not see was missing.,\n When started watching \"Fay Grim\", had idea that was sequel \"Henry Fool\". Now, the latter was not movie that envisioned having sequel. But one has arrived, and it's quite good. assume that you've seen the original, won't explain it. This one starts with Fay (Parker Posey) living with her son whom she had with deadbeat Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Urbaniak) still jail. One day, the son gets expelled for bringing pornographic toy school. But this ordinary toy. holds secret that explains much what happened the first movie. And this secret delves deeper into geopolitics than \"Syriana\".  I must say that I'm quite impressed with what Hal Hartley has accomplished here. Maybe this one doesn't quite reach the original's quality, but certainly takes good look what's going the world. And the end leaves open the possibility for another sequel.  Also starring Jeff Goldblum.,\n Frailty--8/10--It's non-sensical title and \"Bill Paxton Directs\" headline aside, this pretty good old fashioned rip snorting biblical horror thriller. the end, may end only being the inbred Southern Gothic cousin Kubrick's \"The Shining\"---but hey, that's pretty damn entertaining notion. It's also got doozy plot twist...and very ambiguous moral message. This the kind movie that years from now people will catch late night basic cable and scare the beejesus out themselves watching it. Too bad director Bill Paxton had hire himself star...oh well....still devil good rent.,\n rented this tape couple years ago, and boy did suck. From the commercials, was lead believe that this was movie about guy who had luck with women, and that was where the comedy would lie. Boy was wrong. The jokes were vulgar, and they were just not funny. Don't bother. 1/10,\n massive fan fantasy general, and the works Neil Gaiman *in particular*, I've been looking forward this film avidly, hungrily and with such bittersweet mixture anticipation and fear disappointment that can scarcely believe it's finally here. And you know what? needn't have feared, the film version bl**dy awesome. Different from the book, but good way less whimsical, more comical, still deeply sweet and enchanting.  The special effects are absolutely spot-on, and make magic feel natural and proper part the world Wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusive.  Proper attention has been paid storytelling and pacing, and the casting the main triumph, with the ghostly Princes (whose roll-call read almost \"Who's Who\" currently cool British comedy Rupert Everett, David Walliams Little Britain fame, two the blokes from Green Wing etc) stealing most the best lines and pretty much all the films' funniest moments, which exist abundance.   In fact, the one minor criticism have all the film that sometimes the comedy elements become little OTT, subtlety goes out the window the detraction the main story.... Ricky Gervais' cameo, for example, was far too much just \"Ricky Gervais doing his usual David Brent from the Office comedy persona\" for liking, and opinion, created unwelcome and jolting break from the magical spell the progressing story (though fairness, from memory believe the Ferdy character the original book WAS pretty \"Ricky Gervais\"-esquire when think back it)....  But this minor quibble otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with good mixture action and romance. Charlie Cox, the protagonist Tristan, captures the correct mixture naivety, subtle comedy and self-realisation required for story like this where \"humble young boy embarks life-changing quest\"; Claire Danes Yvaine beautiful, feisty and just ever slightly alien ethereal, perfect interpretation her stellar role; Robert Niro, the cameo every reviewer talking about, indeed deserving praise, rollicking good fun (looks like he's having ball, too)... and Michelle Pfeiffer triumphantly cool and nasty wicked witch Lamia, favourite performance the film overall. you enjoyed her deliciously b!tchy performance the recent \"Hairspray\" then you will thoroughly enjoy her this, too.  So round off this review: you will laugh, for sure, you will smile, and you may even cry Stardust beautiful, heart-warming fairytale for all the family, with heart gold and more sass smarts than immediately apparent. One all-time favourite films the absolutely fantastic Princess Bride, and Stardust being readily likened this with good reason very similar type film exploring similar themes and territory.... and just The Princess Bride remains fresh, smart and funny twenty years after its initial release, believe that the delicious tongue-in-cheek sweetness Stardust will showing family favourite our televisions (or equivalent future device!) for many years come.,\n There's group Fox executives sitting around boardroom table wondering what new show commission.   'How about aiming for something like The West Wing?' says one them, but they all agree would too expensive, and cheap less likely harm the station flops.   'Well, how about getting together some great comedy writers and doing quality sitcom?' offers another and fired the spot. 'Don't you know good writers cost lots money!' the big chief barks. 'That's why invented reality TV.'  'We could yet another crime drama...' suggests man bland suit. 'I'm listening...' the boss replies, suddenly interested. 'People like CSI, let's another copy that,' Blandman adds.  'But there are already far too many CSI clones out there, what can make ours stand out?' naive junior enquires and sacked instantly. 'Stand out! that people may confused! Let's give them more what they already like!' the big chief screams.   'Let's just add more violence and make really grisly, are Fox after all,' another suit suggests hearty reply 'now you're getting it', from the big chief. 'We could make them the Deviant Crimes Unit,' goes add, clearly roll.   'By Jove, he's got it!' the big chief laughs, 'and the victims could beautiful and vulnerable women who wear very little screen.' 'Well that would certainly distract people from the average acting and poor scripts,' Blandman points out.   'Then it's settled, just need name,' the big chief announces. 'We could call Sex Cops Violence?'   'Too literal, how about Killer Instinct conveys violence, but sounds bit like Basic Instinct which had lots sex.'   'Puuurfect', the big chief replies and then they all slap each other the back and and cancel Arrested Development.,\n This film describes the experiences couple hit men (one them Burt Reynolds), prostitute, and two drag queens over the interval few hours one night Miami. The convergent storylines eventually bring all the people together one place and time. The movie was mildly entertaining, but the big problem was that everything happens night and many scenes were literally under-exposed the point that was impossible see what was happening. few scenes you can actually see where they tried \"stretch\" the developing process save the images. Somebody didn't know how operate movie camera. Amazing that this film was even released!,\n entered the theatre intending pass pleasant minutes being entertained not enlightened. left neither entertained nor enlightened. This movie can't make its mind what wants and ends being not much anything. There are few funny lines and few incredibly pretentious movie references (The 400 Blows--for this character? come off it!). While none the characters gets treated with much respect, the over thirty gay men get the worst it: all predatory, fat, sad, slobs. you're the mood for movie dealing with gay relationships check out Parting Glances, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Over the Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia instead. You'll thank me. <br,\n When started watching this movie saw the dude from Buffy, Xander, and figured how nice that he's still making living acting movies. Now weird movie can stand, given that it's good dose weird like for example David Lynch movies, twin peaks, lost highway etc. And you sort have the mood for one. This one however made mockingly remember the crazy websites about there about conspiracy theory's that make absolutely sense. mean come people Nazi's who conspire with America make unholy trinity evil powers? was surprised they didn't mention the hollow earth this movie with Hitler flying saucers and lizard people. Maybe you had like grams heroine with this movie would make some sort sense, but seriously don't condone drugs like don't condone this movie. should burned, shredded and forgotten just good ol' Xander might get another acting job. wasn't his acting though, that was alright, but the script just didn't make any sense. Sorry.,\n make point out watching bad movies frequently, and the sci-fi channel original movies tend one the best sources for these movies you can find. such, I'm sure you can imagine disappointment when saw Sands oblivion. The acting was uncharacteristically sub-par, opposed the woefully disgraceful display sci-fi usually has store for us. There are few cameos made people you'd most likely recognize, although you may not know their names heart. The CGI special effects are minimal, and such, one the largest sources comedy sci-fi feature lacking. Sure, there are some funny moments like when guy gets beheaded bulldozer, when the main character leaves his friend die order save girl he's known for couple days, but overall, ends just not having you rolling the floor with laughter, and consider that major disappointment.  If was rating star scale made specifically judge made-for movies, I'd probably give maybe even real shame that may have wait 'till the next sci-fi original movie get good laugh, and really hope that this movie isn't part some overall quality increase sci-fi original movies.,\n One the best not the best rock'n'roll movies ever. And it's not just mindless fun. There really were lot clever jokes it. course love the Ramones. But with all the \"anarchy\" and the hate high school\" themes, the film doesn't all take itself too seriously,which what's great about it.  I first saw the movie the Spring 1980, and saw again recently. Since went high school the late 1970's, made kind nostalgic.   Like said, this film doesn't take itself that seriously and isn't pretentious like much other teen fare the seventies, eighties, and nineties. And speak of, it's not really dirty disgusting either. Only rated. That's rare for movie this category. great cult classic and truly incredible time capsule.,\n The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit together comprise the two best episodes the 'new' Doctor Who's second season. Having said that, should obvious that much the story basically transposes the plot Quatermass and the Pit (1967) outer space setting, with the history the universe intertwined with that the Beast 666. These episodes cement the emotional ties between Rose and the Doctor, whilst also highlighting Rose's increasing self-confidence, establishing her not-quite-equal-yet-but-getting-there partner with our beloved Time Lord. Also note Matt Jones elegant screenplay, which decreases the occasional over-reliance one-liners for the Doctor, and the performances the entire cast, most notably the excellent Shaun Parkes acting Captain Zachary Cross Flane.,\n interest was raised was flipping through and saw the name Iphigenia. name Eugenia thought OK, lets see what this is. glad stayed the channel. What wonderful, wonderful story. Drama, sadness, some over the top acting but wonderful time had. watch this and makes sad for all the drivel the movie industry puts out and these beautiful little gems get passed over. Give Iphigenia try and hope you will enjoy much did. have even gotten children (27, 25, and 17) enjoy it. starts slow, however, the drama builds and you will drawn the story. Watching this lovely film made want shroud myself more Greek tragedy and pathos.,\n Good lord, whoever made this turkey needs buried alive. I'm sorry, but the other reviewer must not have seen this movie, must watching something else, have never seen movie before... out ten stars? He's saying what, this good Ben Hur Gone With the Wind? Unintentionally funny, massively unbelievable characters, absurd situations, looks like was shot Griffith Park (which works out pretty well--MASH was shot Griffith Park), crappy script, just about everything that could possibly wrong with movie all rolled into one package. Should required viewing for all prospective film makers example how movie could horribly wrong. reminds something USC student may make for film class.   Give this one pass unless you drugs and are into high camp.,\n Very well done and spooky horror movie from poverty-row film company PRC who usually put out really cheesy films like DEVIL BAT THE FLYING SERPENT. German expatriate director Wisbar does wonders with small budget and his studio-bound swamp set. Gaunt and ghoulish Charles Middleton effective the Strangler.,\n Characters you don't care about, relationships you don't care about and you sit through all that see the ending you knew was coming from the start. Julia Roberts usually leaves impression one way the other. She was actually somewhat endearing this role.,\n This film should have never been made. Honestly, must admit that before saw had some serious doubts. The director not great actress, though she did lot movies Holland, and the young woman who took the main part TV-personality with constant smile the face and not much self-criticism. The actor who played the other main part recently saw Bride Flight and although that film better, did not convince than. start with the the story, have not read the novel based upon, but the script that underlays the film something that might have been done with mind kids having birthday party rainy Sunday afternoon, not someone the same age the director who likes watch good movie. Something really disturbing were the overdubbed dialogues, was most the time spoken out loud. regards the cameraman, least tried make something out it. pity that the film edited lousy, not, some scenes were certainly more credible.,\n \"Creep\" new horror film that, without doubt, will please many genre fans simply because it's down the point and unscrupulous! has many genuine shock-moments, whole lot repulsive gore-sequences and rare claustrophobic tension. What hasn't got logic and solid plot but, tell you the truth, that didn't bother for one second. When the end-credits start roll, there are still many unanswered questions ponder but director/writer Christopher Smith (in his debut) seemly preferred fully focus tension and adrenalin-rushing action instead long, soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence the \"creep\" the London subway. The story revolves the young and haughty Kate, who leaves her own party order and meet the famous actor George Clooney who's town present his new film. She falls asleep the subway, misses the last train and she finds herself trapped the underground subway network. Things really get terrifying when she encounters mad-raving lunatic who lives the old tunnels and kills/kidnaps people experiment upon. Even experienced homeless people, security guards sewer-workers can't rescue her from this ravenous monster! really dug the creep-character! He's nauseating, hideous and primitive but strange way fascinating. Christopher Smith only leaves clues and hints, and it's merely the viewer guess this vile creature's origin and background. reckon this isn't very original, and I'm sure many people won't appreciate the lack content, but forgive Smith and think it's better this way than going over the top completely, \"Jeepers Creepers\"-style (that particular film started out great well, but soon the Creeper's identity was clear turned into very mediocre horror effort). The obvious aspect-to-love the outrageous gore! There's some severe butchering going this film and the make-up, well the sound effects, are very convincing. The ominous setting the abandoned London subway during night effectively used. There also some acting-talent present this film, with Franka Potenta (Run Lola Run) returning graphic horror nearly five years after the cool German film \"Anatomie\". Creep terrific entertainment when you're undemanding mood and Christopher Smith definitely director I'll keep eye on. Make sure you don't have take the subway right after watching this film...,\n Fans creature feature films have endure lot awful movies lately. Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list stupid, redundant pulp-horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles are particularly successful already had struggle our way through the abysmal 'Crocodile' (directed disappointing Tobe Hooper) and 'Lake Placid'. Blood Surf every bit bad these other films and top that likes exaggerate tremendously. The saltwater-crocodile supposedly years old, over long (!) and kills for fun! During the film, amuses himself devouring bunch utterly stupid surfer-dudes dudettes who came seek new thrills surfing shark-congested area. The only beautiful aspect about this film the tropical location. Even though it's completely inappropriate setting for film like this, the lagoons and nature looks marvelous. Every other aspect simply disastrous. There's quite bit gore but all looks fake and laughable. The dialogues are downright painful listen to! You won't believe some the lines these actors have say! know surfers are supposed mentally underdeveloped group but hope for their own sake they're not that stupid! Early the film, one the characters refers Jaws being 'mechanical toy' but the croc here looks least times less real than Spielberg's great white shark. The visual effects 'Blood Surf' are amateurish and the massacres fail impress. won't say too much about the acting since it's secondary flicks like this. The girls look sexy wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast. You guessed right: Blood Surf very bad film. bad becomes fun again. But 'funny' for whole other reason than James Hickox intended.,\n This film outstanding and wonderfully scored. Prince's Oscar for music was richly deserved (many people don't know won one). think this one the best films watch couple late night DVD. great surprise: Prince does fine job acting, and pretty good conveying pain camera. Morris Day, Wendy, and Lisa are good their supporting roles. Very cool landmark film.,\n The significance French title this film, \"La Naissance des Pieuvres\" which literally means \"The Birth the Octopuses\", rather obscure, perhaps not surprising that has been marketed English-speaking countries \"Water Lilies\". The \"lilies\" the English title are three teenage girls, Marie, Anne and Floriane, who are members synchronised swimming team based the Paris suburbs, and the film \"coming-of-age\" drama about the development their first sexual feelings.  One feature the film, perhaps unusual for film this type, that concentrates exclusively relationships between the young people themselves. see nothing their parents their teachers, and very little the adult world all. The three girls are very different appearance, and are portrayed being very different character. The shy, retiring Marie slim and petite and appears the youngest the three. Anne something plain Jane, Floriane glamorous blonde who very popular with the boys. The three, together with handsome male swimmer named Francois, are involved what might described love-quadrilateral.  Anne has fallen love with Francois, but smitten with Floriane, who seems return his affections, although means her only male admirer. Indeed, not all Floriane's admirers are male, because Marie has crush her attractive friend. The film charts the way which their friendship develops; first seems that Floriane simply using Marie convenient excuse when she fact going out meet boys; her parents presumably object her dating boys, but have objection her going out with female friends. Later, however, realise that, despite Floriane's image the sexy, popular girl who always the centre male attention, she actually reciprocates Marie's feelings. The film reverses some conventional stereotypes about sexuality. Anne, with her short hair and rather chunky figure, looks typically \"butch\", yet she the only one the three main characters who unambiguously heterosexual, whereas the more conventionally feminine Marie and the glamorous Floriane are lesbian, least bisexual.  Coming-of-age films are common enough, although most them tend avoid the controversial topic teenage lesbianism. \"Water Lilies\", however, deals with its subject-matter sensitive way, with three very good performances from its three leading actresses, Pauline Acquart, Adele Haenel and Louise Blachere. The relationships between the characters, especially that between Marie and Floriane, are complex, and capable number interpretations. (Is Floriane, for example, simply using Marie for sex, does she genuinely have romantic feelings for her? Could Floriane's sluttish behaviour with Francois and the other boys just device hide her lesbian feelings from the outside world? even hide them from herself?) This was the first film made its young director Celine Sciamma (only the time); this basis she must regarded highly promising newcomer. 7/10,\n the Hollywood west those trail hands were rough bunch who when they came town, partied pretty hardy. After all trail driving was lonely business back the day before railroads got all parts the USA.   The drovers who worked for trail boss Gil Favor played Eric Fleming were different. But Fleming was man all business, had job and hired top crew it.   With the long run Rawhide and the fact that the regulars stayed with for the most part, got know all the drovers some point. some point story lines were focused around all them, though the bulk were with Fleming and Clint Eastwood's character Rowdy Yates, the number guy with the herd.  Clint Eastwood's western image was molded Rawhide, it's shame that these are not shown more often. Probably because they were done black and white. Had this been NBC show, this would have been done color like Bonanza and running often those shows are. We'd get see lot more man who became move legend.  Ironically enough was Eric Fleming who left the show before closed films. did few them and was hoping the show would give him bankable movie name. Sadly was killed movie location doing action film, drowned river. Had lived might have become name like Eastwood's.  Clint took over trail boss the last season and then the show completed its run. And course became the icon today and not just the western genre.  Rawhide was tough western who had some tough guys it. frills this one, these were working cowboys just doing job and battling the elements and whatever situations they were thrown into every year.  They really don't make television series like these any more. What pity.,\n favorite movie. What great story this really was. I'd just like able buy copy but this does not seem possible.,\n After being hugely entertained Mr. Brosnan's performance cad \"The Tailor Panama\" (which rate 10/10 across the board: casting, acting, script, story, editing, pace, music, emotional impact, etc.), enthusiastically anticipated this film. was hugely disappointed. script reading not film, vulgar for the sake being vulgar, bankrupt every way that \"The Tailor Panama\" rich and satisfying. Blame the screen writing and directing. sat the theater waiting for the \"good part;\" never came. neither laughed nor cried, although one line dialog did make smile. Worth $7? Hardly.,\n can watch B,B&C and feel all the emotions felt when first saw aged well,maybe all but one.Certainly Miss K.Novak has lost none her silky allure nearly half century.She was thinking youth's Diana Dors.All those thinking youths now collecting their pensions can briefly regain the heart clutching,collar tightening,blood pulsing ardour they felt when she gazed directly into their eyes back the days when they were being told that they had never had good.

This movie Miss Novak's Golden Moment.She seized avidly and gave performance awesome voluptuousness combined with hypnotic awareness her own sex appeal and,despite all this,she convinces that her character possesses strange and beguiling innocence. She completely dominates the amiable J.Stewart who seems resigned handing her the movie.Misses E.Lanchester and H.Gingold offer comic relief along with Kovacs whose peculiar talents are strictly proscribed.Mr J.Lemmon plays Miss Novak's brother.He beatnik,a species that disappeared soon realised that its existence was being acknowledged the mainstream.Some the more hardcore beats reinvented themselves hippies few years later.Certainly they had become figures fun 1958 and Lemmon does not appear overly concerned with restraint portraying one.

Give Pia break. She looks great and she has really nice eyes. What's not like? The scene where she gets raped Ray Liotta with garden hose was kind gross and cruel. Actually, LOT stuff that happens this movie gross and cruel. But its trashy movie. lot movies that are trashy are not all bad. liked this better than Valley the Dolls, which was not only trashy but boring well. least this wasn't boring.  Pia gets naked lot and seems miscast writer. Watching her talk about Pushkin and Byron with guy three times her age flat unbelievable. I'm sure Pia's nice person real life, she just doesn't project the writer vibe. She looked much happier when she was working hostess for that guy from Saturday Night Fever and wearing glittery disco dress.  A couple the scenes are funny. The one where she tells the two-timing actor that she's pregnant and rolls his eyes and snaps her \"stop hanging around!\", all the while he's practically fawning over every bimbo who flounces by.  Pia's nervous breakdown scene good. was probably mistake supernova (the vortex floating faces and freeze-frame scream whoa!) and her subsequent catatonic stupor kind overdone.  The acceptance speech hoot, though. want see someone that speech drama class.  But, again, this trash we're talking about. You could find worse any movie the week back the eighties.,\n you've ever seen the trailer for the film \"The Recruit\" with Colin Farrell and Pacino, you'll never have see that film. Sadly, Renaissance has had similarly revelatory trailer makers.  The story Renaissance about detective investigating the kidnapping young woman and medical researcher. The setting futuristic Paris, and science fiction elements feature throughout. The special thing about Renaissance, though, its visual style, and not its story. Renaissance computer animation, like Final Fantasy, but highly stylised into black and white with ultra sharp contrasts. The result looks stunning (although the problems animation human beings are still noticeable from time tome: slightly robotic movements, slightly wooden facial acting, etc) highly stylised, beautiful film noir, Renaissance succeeds stunning the audience, especially visually. The story and writing, though, are not quite the same level quality the visuals. It's not bad story (and presumably, you haven't seen the trailer, it's lot more exciting than was for me). But story that isn't highly original, and verges the corny. few lines dialogue were painfully corny, making the writing sound like beginner's first efforts.  I will definitely recommend Renaissance friends. It's unlike anything I've seen before, visually, and believe its originality alone makes worthwhile experience. also watchable story, even isn't perfect.,\n Rated NR(would Rated for Pervasive Strong Language and Crude Sexual Humor). Quebec Rating:16+(should 13+) Canadian Home Video Rating:18A  Eddie Murphy Delirious Eddie's first stand comedy routine.This came out 1983.Back then starred the movie hrs and Trading Places and was Saturday Night Live.Eddie made two stand comedy films.Delirious and Raw.I preferred Raw because just found the subject matter more humorous.Delirious however also very funny with Eddie talking about his childhood and making fun celebrities such Mr.T and singers such Michael Jackson.Any fan stand-up comedy films should see Eddie Murphy's Delirious.,\n Just saw this tonight seminar digital projection (shot 35mm, and first feature film fully scanned mastered 4k, and projected with projector ETC/USC theater Hwd)..so much for tech stuff. directors (including Alexander Payne, Wes Cravens, Joel and Ethan Coen, Gus Van Sant, Walter Salles and Gerard Depardieu, among several good French/ international directors) were each given minutes make love story. They come all shapes and forms, with known actors(Elijah Wood, Natalie Portman, Steve Buscemi ..totally hilarious..., Maggie Glyllenhall, Nick Nolte, Geena Rowlands ..soo good..and she actually wrote the piece she was in, Msr Depardieu and many good international actors well. The stories vary from all out romance quirky comedy Alex Payne's touching study woman discovering herself Van Sant and one those things that happens anywhere..maybe? Nothing really off putting having French spoken most sequences (with English subtitles) and small amount actual English spoken, though that will probably relegate art houses Diva.) Also only one piece that might considered \"experimental\" but colorful and funny well, the rest simple studies sometimes complex relationships. All easy follow (unless the \"experimental\" one irritates your desire for formulaic story. Several brought some emotions for me...I admit affected love cinema...when presented something other than sentimentality. even laughed mime piece, like other have seen (thank you for that!) The film hit its peak, for me, somewhere around little more than half way through, then the last two sequences picked again. Some beautiful shots Paris night, lush romantic kind music, usually used good effect, not just schmaltz for \"emotions\" sound, generally good cinematography, though some shots seemed soft focus when couldn't have meant have been (main character shot/scene). Pacing each film was good, and overall structure, though bit long (they left out two what was films, but said all would the DVD) seemed vary between tones the films keep good balance. Not sure when comes out, but good study how make min film work..and sometimes, what doesn't work (if covers too much time, emotionally, for short film.) Should region one when released, but they didn't know when.,\n Not only does this movie have poor plot, bad direction, and terrible acting, its opens whole new meaning racism.  In this film \"White\" chicks are the sluts, \"White\" boys are the wana-be gangsters, and successful (yes again) \"White\" businessmen are revolting toilet shitters.  I just wonder what would happen made the exact same movie with the exact same story line and script, only made about Caucasians. \"He dude, its good finally see your've stopped dating those black chicks\".  Nobody seems notice it, but watch this film again and you'll vomit how they have portrayed the new Zealand \"white boys\". All sudden its white folks who are the main cause gang aggression, and whores out for quick bang. Only Samoans girls have heart, there's such thing non-slutty white girl.  It disgusts that they couldn't make this film without giving the Caucasian community New Zealand repulsive profile. you think I'm overgeneralizing, watch this film, and see what you make the \"white boys\". Just because Samoans choose call \"white boys\" actual life, doesn't mean its funny. said hey black boy I'll loose teeth.  Don't see this movie. Don't waste your money. Don't racist.,\n Amy Poehler and Rachel Dratch are among the funnier women have been \"Saturday Night Live\". It's unfortunate that they, along with Tina Fey and Maya Rudolph, were SNL during the longest stretch unfunny writing and sketch-making (circa 2002-2006) the show has ever had. Still, these two women most especially know what's funny, and they know how write funny movie.  You'll notice the credits this movie that Dratch and director Ryan Shiraki wrote the story for \"Spring Breakdown\", but who wrote the actual screenplay, consisting dialogue and all the important fill-in-the-blank material that makes story into multidimensional movie? Yep, just Shiraki. Just one guy wrote the dialogue for this movie, and women apparently wrote the script with him. The result pretty cliché spring break movie that doesn't much spoof the faux holiday much exploit equally much MTV does every year.  If Dratch, Poehler, and even co-star Parker Posey could have contributed their handwriting the screenplay, would have been far less cliché. The premise original, being about three thirty-something women who were unpopular high school (and apparently college, too) who never had the fun spring break trip they allegedly dreamed about. say \"allegedly\" because you never quite know what fun these characters. They entered talent shows the past where they sing stale pro-woman anthems like \"True Colors\", and spend their nights together holding make-your-own-pizza parties. Even though none them are especially unattractive, the outside world appears treat them like they are. There's scene where blind student Poehler's (played Poehler's real life husband Will Arnett) asks her out date, only touch her face and immediately change his mind. Poehler's character supposed unattractive, they obviously hired the wrong actress.  The movie continues show promise, even though have our doubts about the main characters, when Posey's boss, Texas Senator 'Kay Bee' Hartmann (Jane Lynch, funny always) hires Posey watch over her unpopular college-age daughter (Amber Tamblyn, playing yet another woman who's attractive real life, but not the eyes any characters this movie) while she goes Laguna Beach-like vacation spot for Spring Break. Poehler and Dratch come along, they reluctantly get boozed up, party like they apparently should have when they were college, and then comes the ultimate showdown with the sorority bitches lead Sophie Monk.  Sophie Monk incredibly attractive woman who has body both women and men would kill have for different reasons. Unfortunately, her movie career off rough start with the abominably unfunny \"Date Movie\" (2006) and the disappointing \"Click\" (2006). Here, she plays Southern belle, although her voice sounds like she stole Delta Burke's voice box. She hams little too much, trying too hard play conniving bitch that she comes off much like caricature spoiled college kids the rest the extras.  \"Spring Breakdown\" was released straight DVD despite the star power Amy Poehler, but rightly because the story way too cliché. may well have been called \"National Lampoon's Spring Breakdown\", and the magazine probably wouldn't have sued for trademark infringement because the free publicity. director Shiraki had given least one woman the creative input, especially Rachel Dratch, this movie would have been great and not nearly run-of-the-mill frat-house comedies we've seen before. know Dratch will come with another funny concept, and hopefully allowed fill the rest the screenplay herself. She's funny enough, and she deserves better than this half-baked comedy that would accept Stiffler's brother with open arms.,\n Early film directed D.W. Griffith; features gloriously happy King (Arthur Johnson) and his Queen (Marion Leonard) but, wait! When the King leaves the scene, his Queen makes music with the palace's Minstrel (Henry Walthall). When the King discovers the lovers, decides enact horrific Edgar Allen Poe-type revenge. It's difficult believe the lovers can't hear those plotting against them; although the actors are trying look alternately noisy (the lovers) and quiet (the cement mixers). The sets make \"The Sealed Room\" look very staged. The performances are okay, and the story easy follow.   *** The Sealed Room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith Arthur Johnson, Henry Walthall, Marion Leonard,\n The scenes are fast-paced. the characters are great. love Anne-Marie Johnson's acting. really like the ending.   However, was disappointed that this movie didn't delve deeper into Achilles's and Athena's relationship. only blossomed when they kissed each other.,\n Well here with another industry movie. It's sad enough see some badly made films but don't care industry industry produces the film. Show some effort your work. The characters are really bad. The acting isn't question this one (surprise), but plot is. How can tight-knit squad witness two their fellow soldiers butchered, and then nothing happened. What sickened was how the writer even threw the remaining members scene where they joke about how nice the doctor's ass was. Give break.,\n This movie classic every sense the word. very entertaining and also very disturbing. The acting this movie well done. The story itself believable, suspenseful, and well thought out. Character development also done well, the audience can clearly see how each the characters emotionally tested through this film. The villains this movie are very threatening, from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are something. This movie shows how human being, when taken from civilization and put the middle the woods, facing life death situation can slowly become almost wild and feral the animals that inhabit it. Not everyone going like this film, there lot disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable. definitely worth watching. This movie masterpiece.,\n DANIEL DAY-LEWIS does remarkable job playing Christy Brown, the artist who grew with cerebral palsy but managed have productive life, dealing successfully with his handicap and becoming respected artist and writer.  The film, however, very difficult one review--or even watch. Fortunately, had the caption feature catch every spoken word which would have been impossible saw the film theater. While respect brave piece work dealing with difficult subject matter, can't say it's the sort film I'd want view more than once.  Nevertheless, attention was held the story-telling device, flashback framed the present, which see Christy being honored for his achievements before see the flashback his youth and his struggles communicate with those around him, who certainly gave him loving care.  DANIEL DAY-LEWIS certainly remarkable the troubled man who falls love with therapist (FIONA SHAW), much his mother's fear that when the love not reciprocated his heart will broken. There's painfully long scene restaurant where confesses his love her before others and then goes into frenzied rage after drinking too much.  BRENDA FRICKER does brilliant job the mother taking care him, his father and brood siblings while struggling keep roof over their heads until Day-Lewis begins have success with his work. She complements Day-Lewis' performance the warm-hearted mother and shares many poignant moments with him.  Richly detailed story family that stayed together under the most unusual circumstances with attention period detail every frame the film. Both Fricker and Day-Lewis won Oscars, but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also excellent. O'Conor Christy boy and McAnally the father who spends too much time the local pub but loves the boy.  Summing up: Elmer Bernstein's music added plus factor. Well worthwhile, but definitely not film for everyone.,\n The first time saw this, didn't laugh too much. the time, was only about fifteen years old and thought that maybe some the deeper humor was too mature for understand the time. had the same reaction when viewed second time few months ago, and this time, was because Felix's aborted suicide attempt the beginning the movie kind darkened the movie bit. This scene made some the things Oscar said and did Felix later the movie seem needlessly cruel, and their personality clashes weren't amusing they could have been. Had not already known the story, would have been worried that some Oscar's antics Felix might push him over the edge. was, didn't make laugh smile like the television show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall did. Still, all all, pretty good movie and spawned one the greatest sitcoms television. out 10.,\n Fact: Stargate SG-1 cheesy sci-fi series.  There's escaping facts. How much you try excuse yourself explain Stargate SG-1 remains cheesy sci-fi series.  Stargate SG-1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly. Special aren't nearly impressive they could have been and the action isn't going blow you out the chair. couch for that matter either.  But, and this where really think Stargate SG-1 deserves all the credit can get, for each and every episode stolen idea think you can count least one cheesy sci-fi movie that's actually worse than one hour episode.  In fact some episodes actually could probably have been minutes long and still have been better than most movies.  And being able keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further what makes Stargate SG-1 special.  I very picky with selections. follow perhaps one two series most and hold pretty high standards which made even more surprised when found myself caught.  So for those who decide brush Stargate SG-1 yet another tacky sci-fi show, don't. Stick with and you'll see what I'm talking about.,\n Olivier Gruner stars Jacques foreign exchange college student who takes and single handedly wipes out Mexican street gang this obnoxious and racist film which horrible that it's laughable. Bad acting, bad plot and bad fight choreography make Angel Town Turkey.,\n This subject matter deserves much better script, and final result, than this movie serves up. The script full holes because was never conceived story, but rather string nightmare scenarios loosely knitted together. The gaps and loose ends the story line are numerous. The scene where the kidnap victim told that her parents are not dead, and have been looking for her since she was taken, just bizarre. written cathartic therapy moment with the head the shelter for runaways handing her \"missing poster\" from when she was eight. the real world, the head shelter for runaways found out that had, under his roof, solved kidnapping, what would have followed would have been immediate call the police. It's law enforcement issue not minute segment for Oprah. Everything that follows from there the end short shrift that can only conclude that the first minutes was for pure gratuitous exploitation. Funny, that's what this movie supposed condemning. the end seems have joined in.,\n This miracle movie one those films that has lasting, long term effect you. I've read review two from angry people who guess are either republicans child beaters, and their extremist remarks speak the films power confront people with their own darkest secrets. such piece art has ever combined laughter and tears before and that the miracle the movie. The realism the movie and it's performance Bret Carr not missed. The very nature it's almost interactive effect, will cause people leave the theater either liberated questioning their very identity. Bravo the next level cinema.,\n classy offering from Amicus, producer Milton Subotsky and director Peter Duffell ('The Far Pavillions' etc) turn classy, intelligent 'four-hander' with strong cast (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Jon Pertwee, Ingrid Pitt etc) all giving stylish performances, despite low budget which results few 'un-special effects'. The most outstanding contribution, however, that the 7-year-old Chloe Franks who turns chillingly effective account her part which makes one's blood run cold. Only spoilt the lurid title wished the film its distributors, this underrated release, cut above the run-of-the-mill 'blood 'n' guts' shocker movie, for those who appreciate little thought with their horror.,\n Just plain good old stupid.   I mean really stupid, not the good stupid like Killer Tomatoes, Wood movies, this probably the most stupid movie ever have seen. give this movie golden Turkey insult turkeys. call this movie dumb offensive even dumb people.  If this the future American cinema and art are better off really start world war and the same time and let the cockroaches run the show after.   Now have get drunk wash this insult single braincell off....  This really good movie you are suicidal.,\n careful with this one. Once you get yer mitts it, it'll change the way you look kung-fu flicks. You will yearning plot from all the kung-fu films now, you will wanting character depth and development, you will craving mystery and unpredictability, you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backdrops. Sadly, you won't find all these aspects together one kung-fu movie, EXCEPT for Five Deadly Venoms!  Easily the best kung-fu movie all-time, Venoms blends rich plot, full twists and turns, with colourful (and developed) characters, along with some the best camerawork come out the 70s. The success someone liking the film depends the viewers ability decipher which character which, and who specializes what venom. One the Centipede, two the Snake, three the Scorpion, four the Lizard, and five the Toad. Each character has different traits, characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Therein lies the hook, learn along with the student character, finding out who these different men turn out be. are his shoes (so speak), and have pick who trust, and who don't, just like does. learn along with him.  Not only the plot, the characters, and the camerawork great, it's also fun watch, which book makes more valuable than almost any other movie it's kind. It's worth quite few watches pick everything that's going on. Venoms lesson what kung-fu can really do...just don't expect many other kung-fu films live it's gauntlet.,\n Enterprise the entertainment, but also the forefront Science Fiction and positive outlook for tomorrow. With gratitude and respect Mr. Berman and Mr. Braga. wish you well, thank you both for your service Trek.  Enterprise what Trek about...,\n ran across this movie the and could not turn off. Peter Sellers plays unlikable fellow who falls for extremely warm and cute Goldie Hawn (who wouldn't?). The way that Goldie's character holds herself from the beginning the movie the end untraditional even today. This movie gave different angle into human relations and also found very funny. Peter Sellers role was difficult sell, but think pulls off well.,\n One the best (if not the best) Stephen King's screenings. Dark dark can be, surprising non-hollywood ending, terrifying atmosphere, amazing book adaptation, outstanding cast, educational (don't play with afterlife), short everything excellent horror should be...  My favorite horror movie, straight 10+.,\n Alright, before review, have ask: why isn't this listed individually? may have been merely item Italy, but international Lamberto Bava fans this its own FILM. America this film distributed VHS and DVD either \"The Ogre\" \"Demons 3\". Yes, know has nothing with \"Demons\" apart from one cast member and the crew. But yes, personally was upset that this was hard find this site which otherwise useful.  Finally, let's review \"The Ogre\". I've seen the trailer for this many times YouTube and honestly found that rather scary. The movie itself (it feature length, therefore making movie) has many many strong parts and does manage scare. was displeased the last act, but the whole don't regret having bought the DVD before seeing (available from Shriek Show). guess the film's origins explain the last act. won't give out any spoilers.  The plot somewhat familiar: American horror writer vacationing ancient spooky castle with husband and son only find exactly resembles the setting her childhood nightmares. There are faint echoes \"The Shining\", but this different brand supernatural horror. The woman (Virginia Bryant) finds more and more proof that this the real life place her nightmares, but her husband won't believe her. Great atmosphere and terror follow.  The multiple nightmare sequences were pretty freaky. The Ogre cocoon effect was good, reminded bit Uncle Frank's resurrection from the first \"Hellraiser\". There's also few good shocks and well done underwater scene. give them props that the film never stooped imitating American films with similar concepts, namely Nightmare Elm Street\". \"The Ogre\" original. And the monster itself was scary one, when was presented correctly.  On the Shriek Show DVD there Lamberto Bava interview which careful mention that this not part his classic \"Demons\" series. also gives lot credit the real castle which the movie was filmed. Indeed, this setting contributes lot the film. The Simon Boswell music helps too.  There's lots good stuff here. \"The Ogre\" not perfect, but very much worth seeing. Take lesser Lamberto Bava achievement.,\n This movie Great! touched stone cold heart. couldn't relate about the racial discrimination that Antwone has experienced because I'm living own country. guess really hard discriminated.  We watched this film our sociology class New Era University,and didn't knew that was true story, thought was just created intellectual who want bring fresh air the industry. very good.  The part that shocked was when Nadine abused Antwone (who was just six) sexually. were his shoes, could have jumped ten-story high building. salute him for being strong!  The scene that touched here when Antwone finally saw his mother Eva face face. did not bitched her whatever,instead told her about the achievements that got within the long years that they have been separated. think I'll that when get the chance tracing roots.),\n I'm not tired say this one the best political thrillers ever made. The story takes place fictional state, but obviously deals with the murder Kennedy. truthful and honest district attorney (played Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed the single man Daslow (=Oswald) and though all other officials want close the case continuous investigate with his team.  The screenplay written tight and fast and holds the tension till the end. Just the part dealing with the Milgram experiment about authorities (though not uninteresting) bit out place. The ending sequence explaining who Icarus really partly shot slow motion and intensified Morricone soundtrack the most powerful sequence have ever seen movie.,\n This movie farce! Names are grossly mispronounced and the plot twisted and gnarled into something unrecognizable any literature enthusiast. And they have the gall give Beowulf ridiculous cannon/crossbow weapon. Beowulf doesn't need weapon like that! the poem, rips off Grendel's arm with his bare hands! And can't believe that the scriptwriters did such thing. The way Grendel portrayed impressive however. That and the cast are the only positive points the feature. English teacher would insane she saw this abomination. Unless you are die-hard fan the epic poem \"Beowulf,\" avoid this film all costs. And even then, wouldn't recommend it.,\n hope whoever coached these losers their accents was fired. The only high points are few the supporting characters, favourites were killed off the end the season (and one them was cat, put that into perspective).  The whole storyline centered around sex, and nothing else. Sex with vampires, gay sex with gay vampires, gay sex with straight vampires, sex score vampire blood, sex after drinking vampire blood, sex front vampires, vampire sex, non-vampire sex, sex because we're scared vampires, sex because we're mad vampires, sex because just became vampire, etc.  Nothing against sex, would just nice were little more subtle with being peppered into the storyline. Perhaps HAVE storyline and then shoehorn some sex into it. But they didn't even bother that... and Anna Paquin dizzy gap-tooth bitch. Either she sucks her character sucks, can't figure out which.  Another part the storyline that find highly implausible why 150 year old vampire Bill who seems have his things together would interested someone like Sookie. She's constantly flying off the handle him for things can't control. leaves for two days and she already decides that he's \"not coming back\" and suddenly has feelings for dog-man? Give break. She's supposed year old woman, not year old girl. People close her are dying all over, and she's got the brightest smile her face because she just gave away her V-card some dude because she can't read his mind? the main character the story, would've hoped the show would little more make her understandable and someone invest your interest in, not someone you keep secretly hoping gets killed off put into coma. can't find anything about her character that like and even the fact that she can read minds impressively uninspiring and not the least bit interesting.  I will not wasting time with watching Season come June.,\n friend's mom used work video store and got preview movies before they came out, when she brought home The Convent, horror movie, couldn't wait watch it. Given that it's supposed scary but actually downright hilarious, can say that some weird way, like this movie.   yes, the acting bad, and yes, it's the cheapest movie i've ever seen, but it's damn funny! \"WHAT, ARE YOU SMOKING CA-RACK?!\" didn't know this movie even was ever released... figured was too bad...   Yeah, so... overall the movie pretty bad (you gotta admit that much least) but promise you, you will get good laugh out it.  *this movie kinda sucks but it's good for laugh... especially that guy that holds the 'dagger despair'.. THE DAGGER DESPAAAAAAIR!,\n Two years ago watched \"The Matador\" cinema and loved everything about this movie. Obviously, was totally under impression Pierce Brosan's magnificent role. Yesterday, caught this movie again looked bit deeper. Now, can say with certain that this movie isn't that special but you just gotta' love because one man.   Brosnan lifts its grade opinion with amazing performance Julian Noble, tired hit-man who has friends. Soon Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) Mexico City, man who's got bad luck: his son died accident, his job isn't going that well and he's not sure that can keep his wife Bean (Hope Davis).  I always liked movies like this; crime movie with big touch humor. Mostly that humor comes from Brosnan tells jokes about dwarfs with big d.... one favorite lines this movie: look like Bangkok hooker Sunday morning, after the navy's left town.\" Brosnan says with his charm while he's drinking his margarita usually. also like Greg 'typical American face' Kinnear the role loser that very lively made because there are plenty people like Danny Wright.  So recommend you watch quite possibly the best role Brosnan ever. He'll make you smile and admire him the same time. Great Brosnan not equally great movie.,\n can say nothing more about this movie than: Man, this SUCKS!!!!! you really hate yourself and want some severe damage your brain, watch this movie. It's the best cure the world for taking away happiness. When started watching this film, was completely happy. Afterwords could feel brain melting, like was struck molten lava. God, HATE that stupid Dinosaur. you want severe brain damage: Watch this movie, will the trick.,\n guess that this director/writer had something say. Let's see, what could have been... Frog storms would creepy? can get someone like Tom Cruise say the \"C\" word many times and look like bad Patrick Rafter? Cast wife and get her say the \"F\" word every seconds. This aside really liked the beginning and the frog storm. The rest was relentless, over-long (under-edited), over-indulgent failure. Glad many you enjoyed it!  <br,\n This well conceived and carefully researched documentary outlines the appalling case the Chagos Islanders, who, shows, between 1969 and 1971, were forcibly deported masse from their homeland through the collusion the British and American governments. Anglo-American policy makers chose act due their perception that the islands would strategically vital bases for controlling the Indian Ocean through the projection aerial and naval power. time during the Cold War when most newly independent post-colonial states were moving away from the Western orbit, seems British and American officials rather felt that allowing the islanders decide the fate the islands was not viable option. Instead they chose effect the wholesale forcible removal the native population. The film shows that provision was made for the islanders the point their ejection, and that from the dockside Mauritius where they were left, the displaced Chagossian community fell into three decades privation, and these new circumstances, beset homesickness, they suffered substantially accelerated rates death.  Following the passage more than three decades, however, recent months (and years), following the release many utterly damning papers from Britain's Public Record Office (one rather suspects that there was some mistake, and these papers were not supposed have ever been made public), resultant legal appeals the Chagossian community exile have seen British courts consistently find favour the islanders and against the British State. such, the astonishing and troubling conclusions drawn out the film can only reasonably seen proved. Nevertheless, the governments Great Britain and the United States have thus far made commitment return the islands what the courts have definitively concluded are the rightful inhabitants. This very worthwhile film for anyone see, but important one for Britons and Americans watch. silent the face these facts complicit thoroughly ugly crime.,\n Seriously the only good thing about this year ceremony were the winners.  Although the ceremony itself was pretty short still was somewhat boring. think it's seriously time look for new director and producers for the show, who can come with something REALLY new. It's pretty obvious that they tried make the show more 'hip' and appealing for younger audience this year letting Beyonce perform and letting Diddy and Prince present category. Also letting Chris Rock the presenter was attempt re-new the ceremony and make more appealing. None really worked out.  Sure, Chris Rock funny guy but wasn't really good presenter. really merely saw him guy who just talked every now and then between the different categories. His presence wasn't really 'big' for instance Billy Crystal's.  Also the handing out the awards was pretty dumb times. Not letting everybody come the stage but also handing out some the awards the middle the theater was plain weird.  Still, can't remember being any more satisfied with the award winners. None the movies really swept away the awards the last couple years always had been the case. does that mean had been good year for movies with lots competitive contestants? don't think so. think most the movies will largely forgotten years from now, with the exception \"Million Dollar Baby\" and \"The Passion the Christ\" maybe. Sure don't agree with every single award that was handed out this year, for instance Caleb Deschanel should had won for best cinematography, not that don't like Robert Richardson's work, really did some amazing work for most Oliver Stone's work but really feel that Deschanel deserved the award way more. Also would had liked seeing Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win for best editing and John Debney for best music. But well, there way the Academy Awards can please everybody course, understand that. There will always people complaining about the winners.  It also was funny see that most the award presenters were way more nervous than the nominees and winners. Did Prince said any the nominees names right once? And were Sean Penn's sense humor? Pacino and Jeremy hope they missed\" Irons were the best presenters the night.  Overall very forgettable show but with nice winners.  4/10,\n I'm not usually fan strictly romantic movies but heard this was good. was stunned. Easily the most romantic thing I've ever seen life. Stunning. Brilliant, sweet, funny and full heart. The chemistry flawless the writing and directing.  Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are natural and sweet together you really think they're couple.   The movies grabs you right away and doesn't let go. You can't look away nor can you stop listening them. Even the little moments just melt your heart.   This has jumped into the ranks one favourite ever. masterpiece.,\n Even you're not big Ramones fan, Rock 'N' Roll High School *still* the greatest rock 'n' roll movie ever made. Why? Because under all the campiness, treats with respect the contempt and loathing teens often feel (and justifiably so) for the boring, stupid, fascist, establishment world adults. That final scene one the most glorious and uplifting final scenes movie have ever seen. \"Mine eyes have seen the glory the...\" Rock 'n' roll! <br,\n funny comedy from beginning end! There are several hilarious scenes but it's also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which what made the movie for me. Creative story line with very talented cast. thoroughly enjoyed it!,\n borrow from Dorothy Parker: This not film tossed aside  lightly. should thrown with great force.  This excruciating mess. And I'm Greenaway fan.  MIND-NUMBINGLY AWFUL  \"The Mummy Returns\" has much more artistic merit,\n How does Scotsman kilt make love the bonny purple heather? Very,very carefully.Now have the distinct advantage over many other the reviewers that was born Scotland.Far too many Americans take this simplistic nonsense seriously.It's joke,people,\"four legs good two legs bad\",as Orwell had it. Jessica Lange has accent that the Wells next the sea Amateur Dramatic Society's production \"Brigadoon\" would turn down. Liam Neeson apparently popular with the ladies wears his kilt with all the authority man whose Great Grandmama once stepped off the train Edinburgh Waverley. And the Auld Enemy?Where would the Scots without them hate and blame for everything?Messrs Roth,Cox and Hurt should ashamed for indulging such racist stereotyping. \"Robin Hood Prince thieves\" seems masterpiece historical accuracy comparison.And least Alan Rickman was funny.,\n Aardman does again. Next Pixar, Aardman Animation proves again and again how animation properly.  I had great time watching the first episode Creature Comforts. thought translated well for American audiences. only concern that most the audiences aren't going get the subtle humor this show.  Having been fan the BBC version and the short film, knew what was for when sat down watch this. The animators did great job matching pre-recorded voices perfect match animal. Look the first episode with the Goat, who sounds stoned, and the dogs the street that keep calling each other \"dawg\".  Is this for everyone? Not long shot. fact, I'd happy see the show last for full season. But like said before, audiences aren't going get it.,\n agree with one the other comment writers about good story good actors but mismatched, and would also say rushed. has been about 24years since read the book was school. But felt that you would need know the story Jane Eyre when watching this one bits are left out therefore doesn't fully make sense. For example Jane Rochester have hardly spoken suddenly proposing marriage!!! The actors don't have time let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening the story.The actors are good but aren't given enough time this story justice. I'm sorry say but didn't really enjoy this version.The 1970 version with Susanna York George Scott would the Jane Eyre movie preference BUT you should check out the 1983 BBC mini series version with Zelah Clarke Timothy Dalton the main roles. love much watch regularly.There abridged version which goes for 225mins the full version for 330mins.,\n Despite having different directors, this fantasy hangs together remarkably well.  It was filmed England (nowhere near Morocco) studios and few beaches. the outbreak war, everything was moved America and some scenes were filmed the Grand Canyon.  Notable for having one the corniest lyrics song want bandit, can't you understand it\". remains favourite many people.,\n showed this movie the local Film Society, and the art-house crowd had the time their cinematic lives. It's tasteless, groovy and very funny sixties kind way. The Kraft Kitchen recipe sketch had them laughing like maniacs. The rest mixed bag, but the highs definitely beat the lows. the way, whatever happened Ken Shapiro??,\n There are too many new styles the sitcom but the one that works best the old fashioned way with audience and indoor set. That 70's Show great example. When the show came the air, nobody really heard Kurtwood Smith and Debra Rupp much less the adolescents played wonderfully Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both them are leaving the show this year pursue other interests) wish Topher would stay around because the show began about his character, Eric, and his close circle friends. Ashton already the John Travolta our time. Remember when John was love with Diana Hyland from Eight Enough, think Ashton with Demi Moore. The cast actors were never known which good thing because celebrity cast member can spoil it. miss Gaffney who played Don's girlfriend Joanne. miss Lisa Robin Kelly the original Laurie, the replacement could not match her and sorry about that. liked the casting Tommy Chong the wasted but beloved father figure Steven Hyde. loved watching Tanya Roberts besides Charlie's Angels. loved Brooke Shields playing Jackie's mom. She really showed her acting talent before heading Broadway. This show has been delight with many surprises. hope this show lasts longer even though their cast members are leaving but hope they don't stay too far away too long. wish the show's creators, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created other favorite show, Third Rock from The Sun, more successful Fox than they were NBC which sabotaged their show. The Turners are not dummies and hope they create more shows like this the future.,\n the trivia section for Pet Sematary, mentions that George Romero (director two Stephen King stories, Creepshow and The Dark Half) was set direct and then pulled out. One wonders what would've brought the film, the director Mary Lambert, while not really bad director, doesn't really bring that much imagination this adaptation King's novel, which wrote the screenplay. There are course some very effective, grotesquely surreal scenes (mainly involving the sister Zelda, likely more creep-out for kids they see the film), and the casting some the roles dead-perfect. But something feels missing times, some sort style that could correspond with the unmistakably King-like atmosphere, which this case about morbid you're going get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown (who knows he'll save that for his final novel...)   As mentioned though, some the casting terrific, notably Miko Hughes Gage Creed, the little boy who goes from being one the cutest little kids this side 80's horror movie, being little monster say that compliment, course, especially scenes brandishing certain scalpel). And there also juicy supporting role for Fred Gwynne the Munsters, who plays this old, secretive man with the right notes under-playing and doom tone. And applause goes whomever did the make-up Andrew Hubatsek. But there are some other flaws though the other casting; Dale Midkiff good, not great, the conflicted, disturbed father figure Creed, and his daughter Ellie played actress that just didn't work for all.  In terms setting some chilling set-pieces, only couple really stand-out: certain plot-thickening moment (not spoil, does involve cool Ramones song), and the first visit the pet sematary (the bigger one), including the sort mystical overtones King had the Shining. For the most part it's very polished directing job, though could've been made even darker correspond with the script. thought out logical terms (albeit King terms) really one his more effective works the period. But doesn't add like could, should. Still, makes for nifty little midnight movie.,\n This final Voyager episode begins years the future. Voyager has made back home. the many years took return tho, the Vulcan Tuvoks' mind has been destroyed. carried disease they were too late getting home cure.  Captain Janeway comes across aliens who have time travel technology. She realizes, there's Warp Conduit the Delta Quadrant that could bring Voyager home immediately she could back time and notify Voyager. There's one problem. The Conduit deep inside Borg Space.  Janeway visits Tuvok. He's like child. scribbles tho, obsessed, working math problems movie reviews something, he's convinced are important somehow. the institution, Tuvok cries, asking for 'Janeway' please, please come back him.  Janeway decides commandeer federation shuttle and equip with weapons technology years ahead the Borg, the hopes going back time and using this new technology guide Voyager the Warp Conduit.  When she goes back time and links with Voyager, Janeway meets her younger self. The two captains disagree, arguing about the plan. The real-captain visits Tuvok asking him it's true has brain disorder. Tuvok admits it's true, but can't cured the facilities the ship he's kept himself.  The young Captain agrees the older Captains' plan. increase their chances success the older Janeway plans distract the Borg with her shuttle craft. The Borg actually capture Janeway and her shuttle. The Borg Queen personally assimilates Captain Janeway. But Janeway's expected this! the Borg Queen has assimilated virus into herself that kills her. With the Borg Queen dead Voyager makes thru the Warp Conduit back federation space.,\n This film fantastic explores storytelling and fantasy the way child would, for adults. The idea child's drawings becoming place she can physically visit and have influence over wonderful. the same time you could get all child psychologist about and say she's really exploring her subconscious, just all our dreams when sleep. The bit that gives goose-pimples when her Dad the paper house, and chases her. The only thing can't stand that was marketed horror film...it really isn't. you want see something British with plenty storyline which keeps you guessing without the usual cheap thrills most films have use, then watch Paperhouse.,\n Troubled men's magazine photographer Adrien Wilde (well played with considerable intensity Michael Callan) has horrific nightmares which brutally murders his models. When the lovely ladies start turning dead for real, Adrien worries that might the killer. Writer/director William Byron Hillman relates the engrossing story steady pace, builds reasonable amount tension, delivers few gruesomely effective moments savage misogynistic violence (one woman who has plastic garbage bag with rattlesnake placed over her head rates the definite squirm-inducing highlight), puts refreshing emphasis the nicely drawn and engaging true-to-life characters, further grounds everything plausible everyday world, and tops things off with nice smattering tasty female nudity. The fine acting from excellent cast helps matters whole lot: Joanna Pettet sunny, charming love interest Mindy Jordache, James Stacy Adrien's macho double amputee brother B.J., Seymour Cassel Adrien's concerned psychiatrist Dr. Frank Curtis, Don Potter Adrien's feisty gay assistant Louis, Pamela Hensley gutsy homicide detective Sergeant Fountain, Cleavon Little hard-nosed police chief, and Misty Rowe sweet, bubbly model Bambi. Michael Stringer's polished cinematography makes impressive occasional use breathtaking panoramic aerial shots. Jack Goga's ominous rattling score likewise does the trick. Popping cool bit parts are Robert Tessier gruff bartender, Sally Kirkland saucy hooker, Kathy Shower fierce female wrestler B.J. grapples with the ring, and Frances Bay one her standard old woman roles. solid and enjoyable picture.,\n first watched this film part festival new Argentine films 2000 the Walter Reade. Although liked it, didn't think was extraordinary. Watching for second time, found different meaning this look life Buenos Aires.  The film takes place one the darkest days Argentina, the DeLaRua administration was ending. The country was turmoil after the economy, which had flourished earlier the 1990s, under the artificially climate President Menen created. was time when bank accounts dollars were frozen and people got themselves living nightmare.  The story begins just Santamarina, bank employee, fired because the collapse the economy. Instead receiving sympathy from his wife, she locks him out the apartment and he, for all practical purposes, becomes homeless man. takes the streets trying make ends meet.  The other story introduces Ariel, young Jew, interviewing for job Spanish company. It's almost miracle gets the job. His father, Simon, owns small restaurant the Jewish quarter \"El Once\" the center the city. Things from bad worse, when Ariel's mother dies suddenly. Only Estela, the young woman who love with Ariel, comes help father and son.  Santamarina, who clean man, has resort take showers wherever can. chooses ladies' room one the subway stations. When the attendant, Elsa, finds him naked, she becomes furious, but she comes her senses when she realizes the unhappy circumstances this man who has seen better times. They become romantically involved, and Santamarina one his trips through the street garbage, finds infant. Elsa, while surprised, wants the right thing. But Santamarina convinces her the meaning innocent life their lives will cement their love.  Ariel, who has met the gorgeous Laura work, begins turbulent and heavy sexual affair with his beautiful co-worker, who unknown him, involved lesbian affair. Ariel who free lances photographing weddings and other occasions, feels passion for Laura, but realizes what Estela has sacrificed order help his father and still loves him.  Daniel Burman, whose \"El Abrazo Partido\" thought was excellent, did wonders with this film. Things are put its proper perspective after second viewing recently and must apologize for not having perceived the first time around. anything, this second time, the nuances the screen play Mr. Burman and Emiliano Torres wrote, make more sense because they reflect the turmoil what the country was living during those dark days.  Daniel Hendler, who plays Ariel, has collaborated with Mr. Burman before surprising results. not 'movie star pretty', yet, handsome. This actor projects tremendous sincerity his work. Enrique Pineyro another magnificent surprise. His Santamarina disarming. spite all the bad things that have fallen him, keeps rosy attitude toward everyone meets. Stefania Sandrelli, the interesting Italian actress, makes great contribution the film with her Elsa. Hector Alterio, one the best Argentine actors plays the small part Simon. The gorgeous Chiara Coselli seen Laura and Melina Petrielli appears the noble Estela.  \"Esperando mesias\" proves Daniel Burman voice reckoned with the Argentine cinema.,\n This another North East Florida production, filmed mainly and near Fernandina Beach and the Kingsley Plantation. was rather surprised the company was able take over the main street Fernandina Beach long was necessary achieve the street scenes. The film pretty, and pretty bad. Tami Erin cute, but overacts. Eileen Brennan overacts even more. Good for small kids, for those who like fluff large doses. from the Miller-Movies formula.,\n Spoiler: Bunch passive-aggressive people having family reunion. The script has them saying and doing things people would never do, least anyone with shred decency. The hero falls for woman sees his soul mate bookstore the day the reunion, unaware she will show his brother's girlfriend the reunion. tries defer his brother's claim, but she, knowing our hero clearly infatuated with her, teases him mercilessly wearing sexy clothing and behaving like stripper, rubbing all over the brother ruse excuse that she showing him how stretch. one point, she actually disrobes and gets into shower with him. tries cover his eyes. His heart breaking. She thinks it's funny, until she suddenly decides she doesn't want the brother and leaves the reunion.  The movie really drags. The audience coughed and fidgeted its way through the long haul. The writing unintelligent and unbelievable. almost walked out, but kept thinking surely something would happen that would perk things up, but nooooo. All the lovely reviews must have been written paid shills, out dupe poor suckers like into seeing crap like this. Comparing Little Miss Sunshine??? Jeez. Shame them, the writers, the actors, the producers, and the theaters for letting anything this bad make the screen!,\n The saddest thing about this film that only people cared leave review and NO-ONE felt worthwhile leaving comment the message boards.  Made the same year Philadelphia...the Tom Hanks Oscar-winner... this the film that people REALLY should have seen and given awards to. There more humanity, life, love, tenderness and beauty these two people than just about any other gay film have seen... and all true.  In order for this printed need leave few more lines text: suffice say that anyone who REALLY wants know what was like gay the 60's and 70's, and understand just what AIDS was like before the modern drug \"cocktails\" allowed people breathe little easier... this the film see.   Oh, and will add personal comment about AIDS. Despite everything, there actually has been silver lining all the horror. When AIDS first arrived, was called the \"gay cancer\", and governments preferred \"let them die\" rather than spend red cent research help save bunch fags. Then became clear that AIDS would also heterosexual disease. But the government wasn't ready for that; when straight people began getting ill too, the only organizations and associations that were available them were those which had been set gays themselves (examples: The Names Project: the quilt memorializing all those who died AIDS; Act etc) The result that people who probably would never have come contact with gays their ordinary lives suddenly found themselves counting them and needing them, because other organizations existed. This close contact, estimation, what finally broke down the barriers prejudice and allowed the straight world finally accept gays equals. When AIDS first came the scene, many thought that the straight world would use way come down even harder us... and that probably would have been true straights didn't suddenly become ill too; nevertheless, the strides that have been made gay liberation the point that, write this, there are least countries the world that accept gay marriage these gains would probably have taken lot longer without AIDS bring together. sad think that all those people both straight and gay had die before our common humanity became more obvious but what writing here true, and think then there bit comfort taken realizing that all those people did not die vain.,\n definition great movie you want continue see over again. This movie for some reason strikes cord even though the scenes with Scott Glenn still make winch; watch over and over again and love the music!,\n loved this show much and I'm incredibly sad its canceled thought came back too, but just two stupid weeks. Thats terrible. hate how never find out how everyone ends up. sucks. Bring back! ABC has stupid shows like Supernanny and whatnot but doesn't give time good ones like Six Degrees. they're complaining about ratings was probably because they had bad slot because this was truly good show, something could relate and anticipated. Abrams delivered, he's awesome, wish ABC could just trust him enough complete the story. loved the entire cast too. couldn't wait see how everyone would someday meet each other once. Everyone's story now left incomplete, now I'll never know Steven and Whitney would get together Carlos and Mae. wanted see what would happen Laura Damien and everyone else. This really such downer.,\n can not believe such slanted, jingoistic material getting passed off Americans art house material. Early on, from such telling lines like \"we want make sure they are playing for the right team\" and manipulative framing and lighting, Love Divided shows it's true face. The crass manner which the Irish Catholics are shown hegemonic, the Protestants peaceful and downtrodden, poor representation history early westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth the story distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification the Irish Catholics the story; corruption admitted the filmmakers themselves! sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway making film easily recognized for it's obvious intent, far from attempting art. This film has business being anywhere any legitimate cinema library.,\n Such film beauty that it's hard describe. Maybe it's the absence superfluous dialogue, maybe it's the absolutely stellar soundtrack, maybe it's just Meena Mumari's feet, but it's joy watch this movie again and again. I've never seen another Indian movie that comes close it, and few from any country rival its perfection.,\n This mindless movie piece crap and boring like the full house repetitions. For all the people who want see great, exciting and cool horror movie shouldn't even think about watching this bunch mindless work. opinion. have one question, what were they thinking? Let's make list: bad script bad script bad script bad acting bad directing and last but not least bad script. mean not like grumping about every movie, but was disappointed when watched it. This movie should banned into box, locked and sunk down into the sea. please don't something like this again, please, please, please!!!!,\n Currently, this film listed IMDb the 42nd worst film ever made--which exactly why rented from NetFlix. However, saddened report that the film, while bad, where near bad enough merit being the bottom 100 films ever made list. have personally seen least 100 films worse than this one. Hardly glowing endorsement, but just didn't meet the expected level awfulness included this infamous list.  The film begin with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew their belated honeymoon (by the way, they are married real life well). He's doctor who obsessed with bats and insists they nearby cave. Once there, they behave very, very, very stupidly (hallmark bad film) and are soon bitten bat. According this film, bats love attack people and there are vampire bats the US--both which are not true all.  Oddly, after being bitten, the man doesn't even bother going the hospital!! The first thing anyone's mind (especially doctor) get medical help immediately, but not this boob. Soon, he's having seizures--yet STILL isn't interested seeking help! Again and again you keep thinking that this must the stupidest couple film history!!   After while, eventually goes see doctor and sent the hospital. But, then it's too late and his attacks become more violent and begins killing people suck their blood. When it's totally obvious everyone that the man crazed killing machine, the wife (who, like her husband, has grapefruit for brain) refuses believe he's dangerous--even after attacks people, steals ambulance and runs police car off the road!!   Now most the time Moss going through these episodes, his eyes roll back and looks like normal person. Oddly, however, couple times develops bat-like hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics him make him look quite bat-like. Had this been really cheesy, the film would have merited 1.  In the very end, twist that hardly made any sense all, the wife inexplicably turned into crazed bat lady and had swarm bats kill the evil sheriff. How all this was arranged was mystery was Moss' and McAndrew's belief that this film would somehow help their careers--though they both have had reasonably long careers playing bit roles since 1974.  Overall, very dumb. The plot silly and makes sense and strongly relies people acting way too dumb real. Not good film all, but not among the worst films all time either.  NOTE: For some reason, IMDb shows the graphic for the three DVD set for IT'S ALIVE and it's two sequels the web page for THE BAT PEOPLE. While THE BAT PEOPLE has been seen with the title \"It's Alive\", the two movies are not all related. It's easy understand the mistake--especially since they both came out 1974, but the movie just reviewed starred Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew and the other film starred John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.,\n How does usual day start Point Place, Wisconsin...  First all, Red, the tyrannical father the Forman family and WWII veteran, sits the kitchen table and reads his newspaper while his overjoyed wife Kitty serves breakfast. Then comes their skinny son, Eric, sits the table well, and his father starts his daily yelling, usually involving placing his foot Eric's behind (insert reason here). his promiscuous angel-faced sister Laurie home, she comes along, then Red stops yelling and kindly talks her, making Eric feel left out the family.  Once this daily (painful) ritual over, Eric rushes down his basement, where all his friends are already hanging out. And when get see them, becomes obvious Eric and his redhead tomboy girlfriend, next-door neighbor and childhood friend Donna Pinciotti are the sanest people around. Meet Steven Hyde, the conspiracy theorist who hates disco and doesn't really care about what's around long it's not funny watch; Michael Kelso, the kind guy who thinks that will get through his life only his looks and that carrots grow trees; Jackie Burkhardt, the one who thinks herself the prettiest girl around, spoiled kid rich father, and, course, cheerleader; and Fez, naive but oversexed foreigner who loves candy and can't keep secret. first they simply hang out, gossiping and making fun Kelso, but then they all sit circle and let the real fun begin... before going out doing something they'll regret later.  Meanwhile Red goes out and meets Donna's weirdo parents, Bob and Midge. He's rude, but they don't mind, they think he's joking. Somewhere around Leo, aging hippie, who's constantly confused and makes word plays without even noticing.  Did you imagine that seemingly peaceful neighborhood with all these awesome characters? course, most seem \"clichéd\", but the show takes the cliché new level. Now throw some the most wicked story lines sitcom can offer, sit down and enjoy one the best shows ever. The one that never does two times the same thing and which is, compared most sitcoms that are \"cute funny\", purely hysterical. you get hooked, don't let this show let you go. Bite the hook over and over and, man, you will see the sitcom genre from whole new prospective.,\n Nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing! This time, it's being brought you the never-inevitable Fred Olen Ray! far exploitation movies go, this one doesn't click! science fiction, it's plain unoriginal! All that see ugly feminine android wearing bikini out destroy the Earth, and showing off all that's nearly bare resist! Give f---ing break!!! this kind entertainment your thing, then why not dust off those old swimsuit mags from the attic for change?! This would have been much better didn't set the sleaze factor very high, but that still wouldn't make this one great. I'd like point out another film called THE ASSAULT (1996) Jim Wynorski, which resembles the identity ALIENATOR. illustrates why top-notch 1st-person \"femme fatale\" action movies don't translate well America. Sorry, fellas!,\n Phantom Lady (1944) Dir: Robert Siodmak   Production: Universal Pictures  Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis), following nasty fight and split with his wife, looks drown his sorrows the local watering hole. There spies woman similar emotional state and, looking for some companionship, asks her show club get both their minds off their problems. She agrees, but only the condition that they keep their names themselves. Sure enough, when Scott gets home finds the police there, waiting question him. His wife's been murdered. Where were you o'clock this evening, asks Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez)? But Scott has alibi, right? Only doesn't know the woman's name. And the bartender remembers Scott but not the woman. Neither does the cab driver. Nor the drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) the club. Even the dancer the club, who Scott clearly caught looking the woman (they were both wearing the same hat), won't acknowledge there was someone with him. Something going on, but whatever Scott helpless defend himself trial and sentenced death for his wife's murder (on the flimsiest 'evidence' Hollywood judicial history). It's left his loyal secretary, 'Kansas' (Ella Raines), who's later joined sympathetic Inspector Burgess, find out the real killer before Scott executed.  Phantom Lady built themes that recur, almost compulsively, Woolrich's work. For example, the schizophrenic antagonist also seen Black Angel and The Leopard Man. Additionally, there the character who becomes mentally unhinged the death sweetheart spouse found Rendezvous Black and The Bride Wore Black. can leave viewer feeling like he's treading well worn ground. But the right hands, the feverish plots, sorry dialogue, the narrative inconsistencies, all are beside the point. Fortunately, Phantom Lady was being guided sound hands.  This Siodmak's first noir. would distinguish himself one the, not the, preeminent practitioners the style (The Killers, Criss Cross). Here fortuitously paired with cinematographer Woody Bredell (they would reunited Christmas Holiday and The Killers). There some great storytelling done the camera. one shot, the deteriorating mental state character shown sits front 3-way mirror, suggesting multiple personalities. The same character, who artist, has Van Gogh's self portrait with the bandaged ear hanging the wall his apartment. But what Siodmak and Bredell are really doing Phantom Lady practically creating the look for noir. Released very early 1944, it's all here; the wet pavement, the bags atmosphere and dread, the sharply contrasting b&w, the wildly expressionistic versions reality (when Kansas visits Scott prison), the discordant shafts light, etc. terrific picture look at.  Franchot Tone aside, the cast, well the subject matter and relative inexperience the director (and presumably, the budget), suggests 'B' movie ambitions. thought Tone was little hammy. Alan Curtis (High Sierra) not much, and actually comes off pretty weak few scenes. Ella Raines mostly good (and quite beautiful). Her 'sex scene' with Elisha Cook Jr. delirious has seen believed. Another standout scene when Kansas goes after the bartender question him. amounts chase scene, she relentlessly dogs him through the streets, with stop subway station. Some real good tension there.  *** out,\n Around the late 1970's, animator Don Bluth, frustrated with the output his company, Disney was churning, defected from the Mouse House form his own studio. His first production, THE SECRET NIMH, was brilliant feature that still holds well this day. This was followed American TAIL and THE LAND BEFORE TIME, both which were made under the involvement Steven Spielberg and were commercially successful. Although none those two films had the dark adult appeal NIMH, they still are very charming, enjoyable features for both children and grown-ups. But before long, Don Bluth had his first major misfire with ALL DOGS HEAVEN; critics were especially harsh this film, and matters weren't helped the fact that opened alongside Disney's THE LITTLE MERMAID.  Considering that the movie has such friendly-sounding title, one would expect ALL DOGS HEAVEN pleasant family fare. Instead Bluth provides surprisingly dark story involving gambling, deceit, crime, mistreatment, and murder. That itself not problem for animated feature per say, but does call into question over whether the film for children. the other hand, it's hard say whether adults will find much enjoy ALL DOGS HEAVEN. short, it's movie with major identity crisis.  Set dreary junkyard New Orleans, the movie starts out when Charlie Barkin, rough-and-tumble German shepherd, run over car courtesy his former gambling casino partner, nasty, cigar-puffing pitbull, Carface. Before you know it, Charlie finds himself heaven, albeit default. Here whippet angel, Annabelle, tells him that \"all dogs heaven because unlike people, dogs are usually loyal and kind.\" This line represents the confused nature the movie, since the dogs the movie, the whippet aside, are presented anything but.  Upon realizing that he's been murdered, Charlie steals his way back Earth and plots get even with Carface. With the reluctant help his dachshund pal Itchy, Charlie \"rescues\" Carface's prize, AnneMarie, human girl who can talk animals (in order predict who will win the rat races). Charlie claims that will help the little cutie find her family, but reality using her skills win fortunes the race that can build more elaborate casino his own bring Carface down. Although refuses admit it, Charlie does grow love AnneMarie...  The concept the story isn't problematic the execution. Aside from the human girl AnneMarie and flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three-quarters through (with the vocal pipes Ken Page), none the other characters emerge likable, nor frankly, are even worth caring about. Unfortunately, that also applies Charlie; trying make him anti-hero, the script (composed more than ten writers) only succeeds rendering the character TOO unlovable. such, the audience feels empathy for Charlie, and worse, his redemption the end the movie does not come across convincing. (Further damaging the character the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from Burt Reynolds.) Besides the lack endearing lead, the movie's other problem the structure the story. The slowly-paced plot jumps all over the place and makes habit throwing extra scenes which serve purpose but pad out the movie's running time. The aforementioned musical alligator (who resides danky sewer infested with native rats) seems have been thrown from nowhere, does scene where Charlie tries show his generosity AnneMarie feeding pack pastel-colored pups pizza. The whole screenplay feels like rough first draft; bit more polish could have made this tighter, impactful story.  Matters are not helped the lackluster musical numbers Charlie Strouse and T.J. Kuenster (AnneMarie's song and the gator's ballad are the only good ones; the latter particular benefits from Ken Page's mellifluous vocal) the uneven voice cast. mentioned, Burt Reynolds' stiff and lifeless Charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further (the only exception fiery confession Itchy about his true intentions toward the end). Dom DeLuise Itchy pretty good, but he's had better roles, notably Tiger American TAIL and Jeremy THE SECRET NIMH. Ken Page, mentioned, awesome anything does, but his character has such small part that his overall contribution unremarkable best. Similarly wasted are Loni Anderson (as collie who once sired litter with Charlie), Melba Moore, and Charles Nelson Reilly. Judith Barsi AnneMarie probably the only voice that comes across truly memorable, partially because her character the sole legitimately likable one this depressing and joyless show.  Barsi aside, the only real positive about ALL DOGS HEAVEN the animation. Technically, this film has some the most imaginative visuals from Bluth's team (by 1980's standards, that is), particularly frightening scene where Charlie has nightmare about ending fiery underworld ruled gargantuan satanic canine-demon. anything, the movie more triumph animation than storytelling.  On the whole, however, cannot recommend ALL DOGS HEAVEN good entertainment. Even though recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and moving conclusion, the overall package not the same league Bluth's better efforts. Animation buffs will marvel the lush artistry, but the time it's over, ALL DOGS HEAVEN could very well leave bad taste your mouth.,\n This movie has lot comedy, not dark and Gordon Liu shines this one. displays his comical side and was really weird seeing him get beat up. His training \"unorthodox\" and who would've thought knot tying could deadly?? Lots great stunts and choreography. Very creative!  Add Johnny Wang the mix and you've got awesome final showdown! Don't mess with Manchu thugs; they're ruthless!,\n Daniell Steel's Daddy, what refreshing story. This movie glorified the importance the family and the importance parents the lives their children. How rare that? these times \"Heather has two Mommies\" (or what ever, you fill the blanks) easy see why this theme not for everyone. With the father's roles being prominent was hoping this would another Daniell Steel Saga. How disappointing have end. Every character was important and did fabulous job carrying their role. would have loved see each character develop over the years. loved this movie, one will defiantly watch every time it's on. Good story, good acting, and hope this isn't spoiler, but obtrusive sex bad language. Yes touched heart. Warning, get the Kleenex ready. What find sad that this side family life rarely depicted today our entertainment, Television or. Movie's. Daniell your listening, You Girl, give more.,\n \"Der Todesking\"-Jorg Buttgereit's second full-length feature film(the first one was notorious \"Nekromantik\")has central character characters,but instead thematic continuity the act suicide.Divided into days the week,it comprises series set-pieces,each which featuring the self-destruction complete stranger.Yes,the production values are low and it's disturbing,but many ways \"Der Todesking\" extremely effective.It makes you think which sometimes more important than pure entertainment.Unlike the other Buttgereit's works isn't very gory,but there are some unpleasant images like castration scene the Tuesday episode,a decomposing corpse and various acts suicide.The last(Sunday)episode depressing and full pain!-just amazing you want opinion.10 out 10-check out this post-modernism shocker!Disturbing art the purest form!,\n The Education Little Tree just not good could have been. Little Tree's education about things like the circle life and how you should look star help you. Whatever happened the three R's? Readin' 'Ritin' and 'Rithmetic? When the idiot back talks the teacher the boarding school place starts crying and talking the sky. gosh. Sure, the lady was little harsh, but then James Cromwell's character comes and takes him away, leaving the audience thinking that Little Tree was absolutely right. should learn adapt new discipline. Those were the times! Talking star not going change thing! Little Tree needs learn that his adoring guardians are not always right.,\n The director tries Quentin Tarantino, the screenwriters try Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger tries Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn tries Orson Welles, Michael Rooker tries Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore tries Faye Dunaway (older version), Cameron Diaz tries get out the frame quickly she can (successfully), don't ask about Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader try conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff. delivers endless, meaningless dialog and very little action.  Tulsa town with beautiful elevator lobbies, art deco church Bruce Goff and lovely, sprawling mansion Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa, don't watch this movie. doesn't the location justice.,\n This movie one the masterpieces from Mr. Antonioni. about youth, distraction, happiness, alienation, materialism, honor, corruption. And like everything else from great Italian director -true art. <br,\n you're looking either offended amused both, you'll probably have look elsewhere. LMOTP really isn't even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clichés. the end the second episode felt little embarrassed that actually sat through the contrived mess.  Beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention the first place it's just another lame, innocuous and anti-septic attempt commentary and entertainment that the CBC typically excels producing. And once the \"ZOMG MUSLIMS RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO!!\" hype wears out its welcome, the show likely follow into the ether cancellation because it's shallow when judged its merits alone.  Unless you're obsessed with Muslim culture the west and/or are easily amused the most minute idiosyncrasies the subject really don't see how LMOTP enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype. Other shows have better addressed the issue cultural/ethnic dichotomy western multi-ethnic societies. LMOTP will never rank among them entertainment insight.,\n seems shame that Greta Garbo ended her illustrious career the age with this ridiculous mistaken-identity marital romp. Coming off the success her first romantic comedy, Ernst Lubitsch's masterful \"Ninotchka\" (1939), where she was ideally cast austere Russian envoy, Garbo reunited with her leading man Melvyn Douglas for sitcom-level story that has her playing Karin Borg, plain-Jane ski instructor who impulsively marries publishing executive Larry Blake when becomes smitten with her. Once makes clear that work his priority, Karin inadvertently decides masquerade her high-living twin sister Katherine test her husband's fidelity when back Manhattan.  It's surprising that this infamous 1941 misfire was directed George Cukor, who led Garbo her greatest dramatic performance 1937's \"Camille\", because this unflattering vehicle one could imagine for the screen legend. Only someone with Carole Lombard's natural sense ease and mischief could have gotten away with the shenanigans presented the by-the-numbers script S.N. Behrman, Salka Viertel and George Oppenheimer. MGM's intent behind this comedy was contemporize and Americanize Garbo's image for wartime audiences whom the studio heads felt were not interested the tragic period characters she favored the thirties.  However, Garbo appears ill-at-ease mostly the bogus party girl Katherine and especially compared expert farceurs like Douglas and Constance Bennett romantic rival Griselda. Photographed unflatteringly Joseph Ruttenberg, Garbo looks tired many scenes and downright hideous her teased hairdo for the \"chica-choca\" dance sequence. The story ends conventionally but with the addition lengthy physical sequence where Larry tries maneuver his skis series mountain cliffs that unfortunately reminds Sonny Bono's death. Roland Young and Ruth Gordon (in rare appearance this point her career) show comic supporting roles Douglas' associates. This movie not yet DVD, and wouldn't consider priority for transfer represents curio Garbo's otherwise legendary career. She was reportedly quite unhappy during the filming. can see why.,\n had problem with the film, which thought was pretty good. It's the actual LAPD crime scene video that disturbed me. wonder Lion's Gate REALLY thought that the general viewing audience would want see people that were brutally beaten death and blood all over the place. Sorry Lion's Gate, this was INCREDIBLY BAD IDEA!!!  Getting back the film: The cast was excellent, especially Val Kilmer the late John Holmes. John Holmes was sleaze ,mistreats the women his life (Lisa Kudrow his wife, Kate Bosworth his girlfriend),and hopelessly deep into drugs. His connection Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian)creates spiral that resulted the infamous Wonderland murders. Exactly how much was Holmes involved the murders? may never know the entire truth the story(Nash still alive and free man),but the film does pretty good job nonetheless.,\n don't know anything the writer's the director's earlier work hadn't brought any prejudices the film. Based the brief description the plot Guide thought might interesting.  But implausibility was piled upon implausibility. Each turn the plot seemed excuse drag more bloodshed, gruesome makeup, special effects.  The score was professional and Kari Wuhrer seems like decent actress but the rest was more than disappointing. was positively repulsive.  I will not through the vagaries the narrative but I'll give example what think excess explicit gore.  Chris McKenna goes isolated ranch house and pulls the frozen body his earlier victim (Wendt) out the deep freeze. McKenna had killed Wendt biting chunk out his neck. Now feels must destroy the evidence his involvement Wendt's demise. (What are the cops going do, measure his bite radius?) McKenna unwraps Wendt's head and neck from the freezer bag it's in, takes ax, and begins chop off Wendt's head. Whack. Whack. Whack. The bit the keeps chipping away Wendt's neck. The air filled with nuggets flying frozen flesh, one which drops McKenna's head. (He brushes off when he's done.) McKenna then takes the frozen head outside small fire he's built. sits the head the ground, squats next it, takes out some photos woman he's just killed, and shows them Wendt's head. \"Remember her? could have really made hadn't been for you guys,\" tells the head. \"Duke, you've always liked bonfires, haven't you?\" asks. Then places the head the fire. only get glimpse burning but can hear the fat sizzling the flame.  I don't want this sort garbage censored. I'm only wondering who enjoys seeing this stuff.  There's reason with the rest the movie. Well, I'll mention one example \"implausibility,\" since brought the idea up. McKenna has been kidnapped and locked dark bare shack. knows he's going clobbered half death the following days. (He's literally invited the heavies it.) What would you this Poe-like situation? Here's what McKenna does what may turn out the last night his life. finds discarded calendar with pin-up girl and masturbates (successfully). Give that man the Medal Freedom!   A monster who looks like Pizza the Hut thrown into some unnecessary flashbacks. The camera often hand held and wobbly. The dialog has lines like, \"Life piece s***. else it's the best all possible worlds. depends your point view.\" Use made wide angle lens that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks. house blows explosive fireball the end while the hero, McKenna, walks towards the foreground.  Some hero is, too. first kills man for $13,000 bashing him over the head several times with heavy statue, then potted plant, before finally tipping refrigerator over onto the body. (This bothers him little, but not enough keep him from insisting payment.) Then, hope have the order straight, kills Wendt ripping out part his neck. Then kills the wife his first victim accident and blames the heavies for it, although almost any moral calculus they had nothing with it. Next burns the head honcho (Baldwin) alive. Then, having disabled the two lesser heavies, deliberately blows them up, though one them isn't entirely unsympathetic. And we're supposed rooting for McKenna.  These aren't cartoon deaths like those the Dirty Harry movies either bang bang and you're dead. These are slow and painful. The first one the murder for $13,000 done clumsily enough resemble what might happen real life. isn't really easy kill another human being, Hitchcock had demonstrated Torn Curtain. But that scene leads place any importance.  Some people might enjoy this, especially those young enough think that pain and death are things that happen only movies. Some meretricious stuff screen here.,\n Our Song marvelous example passionate, movie making its aesthetic best. is, fact, genuine wonder movie; penetrating and insightful work art that chronicles the lives three young inner city (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) girls during particular summer their lives when the perplexities their approaching adulthood will compel each them make number difficult, life altering choices that will likely re-define who each them is, well how they will continue relate one another years come.  Jim McKay's writing/direction graceful and uncluttered. There sappy, gratuitous sentimentality nor are there cliché ridden solutions this film. What see here seems, times, heart breakingly real. There naturalism credibility, you will Our Song that surpasses that other giants this genre, including American Graffiti and Cooley High.  Much the credit for the film's spirit goes its principle actors. The combined presence Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha), and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) dazzlingly powerful. would easy and, course, blatantly obtuse dismiss, some apparently have, the performances these three apathetic unemotional. fact, their quiet charm, their instinctive sense dignity and their raw, sometimes unconventional intelligence, throughout the film, are absolutely riveting. One would have completely \"out touch\" with, completely indifferent to, the behavior teenagers miss the resounding authenticity what these three young ladies bring the screen. Likewise, the supporting cast, particularly Marlene Forte Lanisha's mother, compliments the work the three girls well the overall tone the film.  Our Song film not missed anyone any age.,\n you are viewing this show for the first time, you may start wondering you are alternate reality. Colorful and imaginative characters? Entertaining dialogue? Plots that seem have some depth them, even creating atmospheres suspense and drama times? mean, this syndicated children's show right? This the same venue that has brought kids such drek \"Pokemon\", \"Pepper Ann\", \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\", and \"VR Troopers\" (please note that three the titles mentioned above are crass Japanese exports, courtesy the Fox Network and Saban Entertainment). Don't worry, you are just sampling some the quality fare that was available kids during the late 1980's and early 1990's. Some examples this period would \"Transformers\", \"Garfield and Friends\", \"Captain Power\", and \"C.O.P.S.\" cartoon NOT confused with the live action show Fox). Besides these prime examples, Disney also returned syndicated programs for kids, coming with lineup called \"The Disney Afternoon\". Aside from dumbed-down show called \"The Gummi Bears\", early shows like \"Darkwing Duck\", \"Duck Tales\", and \"Chip Dale's Rescue Rangers\" gave credence the Disney animation teams that were also turning out theatrical classics like \"The Little Mermaid\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"The Rescuers Down Under\", and \"The Great Mouse Detective\". But above all these wonders shines \"TaleSpin\". The premiere \"Plunder and Lightning\" was two-hour thrill ride, and won Emmy. Much delight, the rest the episodes were par the promise the premiere.  While enjoy the plots and dialogue, guess for the greatest attraction are the characters. There's Rebecca Cunningham, independent female, but still fallible; Kit Cloudkicker, full pre-teen angst and optimism; Louie, with his loyalty and support; Frank Wildcat, the most entertaining engineer since Scotty the original \"Star Trek\"; Molly Cunningham, cute and witty, but with some depth that most child characters don't have, and course the middle all, there's Baloo, whom would describe slobby version James Bond. This because whenever there's trouble, Baloo saves the day with the assistance his sleeker-than-most, fastest-of-all Sea Duck (Read: James Bond's Aston Martin). course every great show has have great villains, and TaleSpin doesn't disappoint here either. From the megalomania businesstiger Shere Kahn, the vain and always failing air pirate Don Karnage, the hilarious and inept Soviet-satirized Thembrians. The animation good, the music appropriate, and the episodes are (for me) the finest that children's programming has ever had offer. Great fun for the WHOLE family!,\n Chase has created true phenomenon with The Sopranos. Unfaltering performances, rock-solid writing, and some great music make what has become quite possibly the best show ever.  All the cast are strong, but Falco and Gandolfini earned every inch those Emmy's. Anyone who doubts this need only sample few episodes; particularly from the first few seasons. James Gandolfini absolutely fierce, absolutely terrifying, and you still find yourself loving him mesmerized him.  Many people that I've spoken about The Sopranos (who haven't seen yet) will say \"I'm just not fan mafia movies/shows\". Whatever. Run don't walk and get it. Those same people usually love \"E.R.\", but bet they don't much care for hospitals... It's not about the context.,\n Mr. Destiny 3.5/5 Stars  \"Mr. Destiny's\" theme recycled from many films spanning many different years. Its theme ranges from recent spoofs such plots (see \"Scrooged\"), the same, more serious and dramatic notion that worked \"It's Wonderful Life,\" and century earlier the story Scrooge told Charles Dickens Christmas Carol.\" \"It involves ungrateful man being taken guided tour his life, and witnessing how his life could have been (or would have been) first-hand.   In most these types movies the guardian angel rescues man from ungratefulness and shows him his life retrospect, how could have been. Should have been. Would have been. this case are shown businessman named Larry (James Belushi). hates his life. lives with unexciting wife (Linda Hamilton) and yearns for bigger life with bigger meaning. only had hit the ball the state championship high school years ago. convinced his life would have been better. guess remembers this seemingly small moment his life because made big impact his subconscious side, but doubt grown man would yearn for one single act from high school. Still, works the movie.  Anyway, Larry driving home from work one night, where penpusher along with Jon Lovitz, when his car breaks down. wanders into bar looking for pay phone, and reluctantly decides tell the bartender (Michael Caine) about the way his life turning out. This where first see him remembering his childhood baseball strike-out.  The bartender listens and nods, apparently not worrying about any other customers. This probably due the fact that the bar, though old and tattered, seems have never been occupied any living humans save these two men. fact, Larry even makes comment about never seeing the bar before. This most likely for certain reason that the audience expecting before Larry.   So the bartender, who may well angel God incarnate, just like Clarence, fixes Larry special drink his, which ends putting Larry's life reverse, showing him what his life would have been like had hit the home run all those years before. But Larry has idea any change first, just like Jimmy Stewart didn't realize that Clarence had erased his life until went into the bar and got kicked out Larry continues oblivious any change until goes his home find the lawn different outside, and large, wrestler-type man occupying his home.  Larry soon finds out his life would indeed have been very different had hit the home run. Instead marrying Linda Hamilton married Rene Russo and moved into large mansion with children. finds out that Jon Lovitz longer his friend but employee his. And the most surprising fact all that with his new life, that Larry has always wanted...he finds himself lusting after his old wife, Linda Hamilton; proof that sometimes money and great-looking yet shallow wife don't make everything man's life, like intelligent wife and love and true happiness. Just like \"It's Wonderful Life\" showed the audience man's life what makes it, and that every person has impact people, \"Mr. Destiny\" shows that material wealth not the same spiritual wealth, lesson taught over and over again, but never quite fluffy, forgettable and truly sweet shown \"Mr. Destiny.\"  \"Mr. Destiny\" never exceedingly hilarious, but sweet, good-natured comedy that never takes itself too seriously. The problem with all the \"It's Wonderful Life\" retreads out there, like \"The Family Man,\" that they try influential and memorable \"It's Wonderful Life\" was. But there are only many times you can single-handedly rip off famous film, and \"Mr. Destiny\" knows this, and plays right the fact. doesn't try anything isn't; rather, something didn't try be, and this obvious the audience.  <br,\n Many moons ago when was seven years old, can vaguely remember seeing trailer for this movie. appealed naive sense curiosity and decided ask parents take this movie. Being the wise adults that they are, they told \"Absolutely not! It's bunch trash.\" course, was very disappointed that would not the first kid block see the \"Incredible Melting Man.\"  Little time passed maybe couple days. forgot about \"The Incredible Melting Man\" and disappointment faded. Twenty-five years passed until re-entered the forefront thoughts. While surfing through channels digital cable, found this long-lost relic movie. curiosity was piqued and decided finally partake this fruit forbidden parents. should have listened them. The \"Incredible Melting Man\" perhaps the worst movie known man. makes movies such \"Def-Con \"Metalstorm\", and \"Freddie Got Fingered\" look like Oscar nominees. feel violated for wasting almost two hours life watching this vile filth. The story was incoherent and the effects were crude even for 1977. How anyone convinced film company produce this movie beyond me.  Don't make the same mistake that did. Listen your parents they forbade you watch this movie. They were right.,\n was obvious that this movie designed appeal the Chick Flick audience, which have sat through quite few and enjoyed most. However, this was very irritating attempt Heather Graham become the next Meg Ryan who became annoying hell her own right Her acting was overdone and appeared that she was overanxious compared her colleagues who were relaxed their roles. This film might have been more, there was suitable budget for settings, actors and decent story line. wife and both agreed that this was 'Muck' the end, the film ended painful embarrassing high! Better luck next time, hope Miss Graham sticks the type films that she belongs like From Hell.,\n   Back his youth, the old man had wanted marry his first cousin, but his family forbid it. Many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and allows his son and daughter marry and have children. Soon, the sister bored with brother #1, and jumps the bed brother #2.  One might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere remote island. But they are upper class Europeans going college and busy the social world.  Never see flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers. Never see any flirtatious moment between any non-related male and the one sister. All flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister.  The weakest part GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young emperor Commodus would have hundreds slave girls and city full marriage-minded girls all over him, but only wanted his sister? movie incest your cup tea, then SUNSHINE will (slowly) thrill you end.,\n the only one who saw the connection between the discussion camus 'the myth sisyphus' and mary's life? camus version man condemned spend his eternity with giant boulder that must roll hill. unfortunately every time reaches the top the boulder slips and ends back the bottom for him start. there may have been buzzard pecking his eyes, i'm not sure right now. the movie mary spends her life struggling get her life together, unfortunately every time she gains any footing she falls and loses everything. case point would the party she throws where she gets intoxicated, offends her falafel lover, and practically attacked liev schrieber. case you question this theory, note how this scene ends with her attempting climb flight stars while books fall from nowhere impeding her progress until ultimately she passes out. the next morning when she awakens she still the stairs, never having reached the top.,\n This could have been the gay counterpart Gone With The Wind given its epic lenght, but instead satisfied itself being huge chain empty episodes which absolutely nothing occurs. The characters are uni-dimensional and have other development the story (there's actually story either) than looking for each other and kissing. It's shame that interesting aesthetic proposition like having almost dialog completely wasted film than makes effort examining the psychology its characters with some dignity, and achieving true emotional resonance. top that, pretends \"art\" film using the worst naive clichés the cinematic snobbery. But anyway, someone can identify with its heavy banality, guess that's fine.,\n spoilers here but have been fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series, which only have been far awful. The stories bear resemblance the original idea the series. found these the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous. BBC licence payer, after the show rang BBC complaints pass disappointment. I'm amazed that actors the calibre Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone didn't object the story lines. These actors have been with these characters for seasons, surly they can see it's lost all direction. It's good job the last series the next series may start with the team investigating the death Father Christmas!  Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.,\n Although this film somewhat filled with eighties cheese have place for DVD rack and don't know why. think like because the moral the story 'television garbage turn off and and get life'. For those you who decide heed the message then you should try reading the book, its nothing like the film all. ruin for you the end the story fatally wounded Richards ends crashing plane into the network building, killing himself, everyone inside and shutting down the network the same time. read many years ago but today would hard not compare 9/11.,\n The film, Universal release Protelco-MLC production, boring retelling the theory breaking down the molecular structure object, capturing cell \"pure energy,\" and then sending back complete \"target area.\" There explanation WHY this necessary, but Professor Paul Steiner (played pock-mocked actor Bryant Haliday, \"Devil Doll\") thinks it's something dedicate his, and his assistants', Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell (Ronald Allen), lives to.   During experiment before noted Dutch scientist \"Lembach\" (Gordon Heinz), his machine fails due sabotage, has himself \"projected\" his secretary, Sheila (Tracey Crisp) seek revenge. course, she screws and comes out looking like \"pork roast\" with the power electrocute people.   With this new-found power, manages zap some Cockney idiots, security guy named Latham (Derrick Marney) and his lab boss, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Woodland). also able break into pharmacy and steal pair rubber gloves and black coat, well.   In the end, though, despite Hill and Mitchell's attempt help him, the clown destroys his equipment and himself. the whole, completely pointless movie with message all.   Also one the most depressing color films you will ever see.,\n This movie was highly entertaining. The soundtrack (Bian Adams) simply beautiful and inspiring. Even more impressive Brian Adams doing all the songs French well. The score also uplifting and dramatic.  The movie made from mix traditional animation, combined with computer generated images. The result truly stunning. watch this film least once week with kids and never tire it. The story compelling and well narrated.  I don't understand anyone who would rank this movie less than Definately keeper household.,\n Laurence Fishburne fine actor, and deserves respect for trying this, but not class with the great Shakespeareans like Olivier and Welles; and further suffers from Kenneth Branagh. This Irishman, always brilliant, cleanly steals the show away. Olivier recognized that potential his production, and cast Iago with someone knew could upstage. didn't nearly realize the possibilities Iago, Shakespeare's most evil character, but Branagh shows the depths. Nice see the views Venice, too.,\n excellent example the spectacular Busby Berkeley musicals produced the early 1930's. Audiences must've been very surprised see James Cagney this type vehicle. Quite contrast from his \"Public Enemy\" years earlier. Cagney does add spark interest rather routine tired out formulated storyline plot. But the highlight the movie the elaborate production numbers back back. First with the conservative \"Honeymoon Hotel\" number,then followed the very spectacularly eye dazzling \"By Waterfall\" sequence,followed the closing \"Shanghai Lil\" sequence, Cagney only participates the last number hoofing top bar counter with Ruby Keeler. The \"Shanghai Lil\" number with Cagney excellent but bit comedown anti climactic after the more exciting incredibly mind boggling \"By Waterfall\" choreography.If was the director would've inserted the \"Shanghai Lil\" number the middle close with \"By Waterfall\",which blows the other numbers out the water speak view the best the numbers. The production numbers are the frosting the cake James Cagney's performance added decoration the cake. outstanding musical achievement,a star movie, the ultimate musical,well worth watching,you won't disappointed!!!!!!!!!,\n might not have been the biggest Blair Witch fan but nonetheless appreciated that effort, was looking forward Altered, especially after reading the superlatives thrown around various IMDb comments. \"Unique\", \"intelligent\", future cult classic\" and on... you gotta wonder where people come with that stuff describe such poor effort.  Because alas, Altered poor, weak movie that fails engage any and every respect. The silliness not funny. The horror and gore not scary. And whatever \"thinking\" aspect some poor fellows saw this movie were due severe delusions because there's certainly nothing profound smart about this mess.  OK, know nothing stands out. least bearable? the experience worthwhile any way? Unfortunately, no. For starters, get very poor acting. It's not stretch say most B-movies these days feature better acting. The plot? Boring and messy. Dialogs? Many amateurs actually better.  It's really the direction that puzzles. did not expect major improvements over Blair Witch but least small steps forward. Instead, our director seems have worsen over time, completely oblivious previous experiences.  If there major flaw Altered, it's the main set. major part the plot takes place single location, where the main characters are confined but Sánchez has failed give the place any personality whatsoever. Considering that Blair Witch, the forest plays major part and much character (an antagonist, you will) the three students, you would think the director would realize the same thing was needed here. But no... this place has personality whatsoever thanks sloppy direction and attention details.  There's nothing salvageable here. Die hard fans \"Blair Witch\" are better off following Daniel Myrick. Although his output far from being golden, shows better structure than Sánchez and some lessons from Blair Witch are applied (unfortunately, weak stories but still).,\n killer, wearing plastic white mask and black overcoat, killing the friends Hollywood producer Shawn Banning(Danny Wolske)who inherited his position when someone sliced open his former employer from crotch chest. Perhaps the psychopath newly hired Maddy(Dabbie Rochon), attractive, raven haired beauty with troubled family past, plagued with nightmares. Shawn and his friends play practical joke Maddy, concerning supposed Murder Club they started where each member randomly selected victim kill. When Maddy accidentally murders woman parking garage because dent put into her car this person, she finds that Shawn's pals were jerking her chain. But, Shawn and his comrades are concerned about Maddy's admittance towards committing the murder and contemplate turning her into the proper authorities. Deciding wait definite decision, each member fall prey the white-masked psycho with Maddy suspect considering the fact that she already has killed before. Or, someone else behind these murders? Low budget slasher, executive produced Charles Band, with gore murders that fail convince. Plenty tits display and Allen Nabors goofy character Chris might entertain those with low expectations. The murders include stomach being opened with intestines showing, neck sliced, electrical cord thrown into pool frying female victim who had all day escape, buried into the back male victim, and, top all, couple are strangled rope during their sexual climax(..for added effect, the killer uses the breaker bar socket wrench extra leverage twist the rope tight possible snapping their necks). There are enough plot holes drive truck through, such why Maddy has nightmares murders she didn't commit, how she could murder someone violently(..with blood all over her)winding waking her bed without leaving something the scene the crime that would easily implicate her, and how Shawn could long, allowing her continue working the company despite what she told regarding the murder she committed, and continual desire join the supposed club that doesn't exist.  What bothered the most was the film's desire for having somehow sympathizing with this female protagonist who wanted join club after killing someone, later proclaiming accident. The film builds Maddy the potential psycho throughout because her past. Her family disowned her for abortion. She has black-outs and always appropriately winds the scenes crimes after the fact. lot slashers, the one who seems the most likely killer often the red herring, but this film goes out it's way point the finger Maddy. When the twist occurs, we're left rooting for Maddy, yet know she's not right the head. It's tough sell caring for this chick. She does look great man's Army shirt, though. And, Rochon isn't afraid let her puppies breathe, either. Low budget horror fans will get kick out seeing cult favorite Brinke Stevens religious fanatical mother who preaches against what Maddy did, calling her murderer beloved Troma producer Lloyd Kaufman the aloof father who can not get word edge-wise protect the daughter truly cares about. Cult siren Julie Strain has minor cameo, showing her tits(of course)as the opening murdered male's girlfriend getting her head crushed hammer. Oh, and check out the office for which Shawn works, you'll see lot Full Moon posters and art-work spread throughout the walls.,\n Excellent story about teenagers, leaders, high school football \"stars\". How far will you protect your friends? Lie, kill? How much can You lose you stud innocent girl? Can love beat the odds? Can you defeat narrow-minded small town people? When your friend scores and you \"lose\", will you everything your power make her pay for it, will you man about it, and respect her right chose? Will you rape her and show your victory over \"problem\" girl? Can you stand the one who's only sin have opinion her own, able make her own decisions, chose for herself? made think twice before giving judgment about who was right and who was wrong, but one for sure very disturbing movie and theme general. Thumb up!,\n The Japanese have always had incredible ambitions their fantasy movies. They have always been ready destroy cities huge plastic monsters coming from outer space and elsewhere. The problem they have never had the money succeed making convincing special effects. This film, released France under the title Les envahisseurs l'espace, exception. Its ambition show three creatures from the giant octopus the giant lobster trying have the upper hand the humans. It's extremely awkward and laughable, but well quite enjoyable too. After all, like these creatures and these films after all, don't we?,\n enjoyed every moment this beautiful film and was intrigued about this female painter had never heard before. set out exploring her life and work afterwards. could expected, found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate. was little astounded however the very negative comments the film because this inaccuracy. Come on, guys, film isn't and shouldn't biography (nor novel!). Any historical film distorts reality, because should work art its own right. film director fully entitled use elements from reality and history create world his own. Artemisia wonderful film and think brought many people (including some that now give negative comments) explore the life and work this fascinating artist.,\n I'm not going criticize the movie. There isn't that much talk about. has good animal actions scenes which were probably pretty astonishing the time. Clyde Beatty isn't exactly matinée idol. He's little slight and not particularly good looking. But that's OK. He's the man that lion cage. know that when can't take the time away from his lions tend his girlfriend, will end island with her and have save the day. Someone said earlier that history lesson. The scenes the circus are another day, especially the kids who hang around. didn't realize that even back the thirties, they sailed three masted schooners. looked like something out 1860. guess that's the stock footage they had. wonder the thing got wrecked. They're always talking about fixing her up. There's even dirigible. tells little about male female relationships the time, kind giggly silliness. But you don't take too seriously, you can have fun watching it.,\n caught this movie the Sundance Channel cable one late afternoon. You might say \"Who Loves the Sun\" perfect leisurely pastime story, why ever not. You get hang out with the trio: Lukas Haas Will (returning after abruptly leaving everyone years ago), Molly Parker Maggie (we learn she's very much part the family Bloom), and Adam Scott Daniel (is friend foe fiancé), the scenic Falcon Lake, Manitoba, Canada, captured graphic compositions juxtaposed vivid summer colors against sunshine and shadows. And supporting the trio are two more family members the revealing mix: Wendy Crewson Mom Mary Bloom, and R.H. Thomson Dad Arthur Bloom. Writer-director Matt Bissonnette has delivered ingenious unfolding story-line and its various tentacle links worry not, Haas may have 'listless' face, but humor will come Parker and Scott enter the circle friends reunited, wry smiles will break and knowing delights stir. Dialogs may terse even nil, yet we'd get the flavor what's cooking, bemused wondering.  Yes, \"Who Loves the Sun\" can very well categorized sleeper gem. The chemistry between all five principals sure gels and 'combusts', giving energetic ensemble performance. After all, it's all the family, and the film sure doesn't take itself too seriously.  Looks like the official site still available \"wholovesthesun.com\" and there are information the soundtrack Mac McCaughan (Portastatic with guitar tunes and strings) where score excerpts are being played, and behind the scenes production notes, interview with writer-director-producer Bissonnette how the movie and concept came about, the casting and more. Have always appreciate Molly Parker since her spare yet mesmerizing performance 1996 Lynne Stopkewich's 'Kissed', and she's married Bissonnette, who \"wrote the Maggie part for Molly.\",\n The book fantastic, this film not. There reason this film could not have embraced futuristic technological vision the book. Hell, total recall was released few years later and that did good job it, even clockwork orange released the 70s did good job trying make futuristic world. The bleak German expressionistic colours, the black and white footage from the vision screens, there reason for this approach for when the film was made 1984. The main character white collar writing job yet dresses like works with oil and grease garage. This film decides take mock-communistic approach set design, atmosphere and theme, yet the novel did not necessarily dictate communist, worship-the-humble-worker theme itself. This book seriously needs adapted modern context this book more relevant today than ever before. could not watch more than minutes this crap. The soundtrack annoying, the lack foresight annoying, this film seems have been made deny sense realism believability when that exactly what required hammer the novel's messages the viewer.,\n Based Christy Brown's autobiographical novel, this endearing film tells the story his life, him being affected cerebral palsy and being considered basically not person everyone including his mother. Amazingly, teaches himself draw and write using his foot, which the only part him can control. amazing story courage with truly amazing and unforgettable oscar winning performance Daniel Day Lewis.,\n ...]"
